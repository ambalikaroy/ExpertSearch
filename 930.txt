 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me I grew up in the great state of New Jersey. Once I realized I wasnt going to become the next Bruce Springsteen, I knew I needed to change career paths, quickly. I planned to study English in college, but I was sidetracked by an introductory neuroscience course and fell in love with the human brainI was hooked. I was drawn to neurosurgery specifically for the focus and technical skill it requires. Meet Neurosurgeon Dr. David S. Gordon NYU Langone neurosurgeon Dr. David S.

At NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn , I treat people who have vascular diseases of the brain, including strokes, aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and tumors that arise at the base of the skull. I perform minimally invasive catheter-based techniques and open surgical techniques for complex vascular and skull base conditions of the brain and spinal cord. I am grateful for the relationships I build with my patients and their families. I work with them during times of great stress and anxiety, and I am humbled by the trust and confidence that they place in me. I do not take this responsibility lightly. I am lucky to be a part of an exceptional team of outstanding and talented people from multiple disciplines. I am proud to be a part of NYU Langones Brain and Spine Tumor Center and Center for Stroke and Neurovascular Diseases , both of which aim to provide the safest, most effective, and least invasive care to patients who have complex neurosurgical problems. In addition to my clinical work, I was a primary author of the initial Guidelines for the Surgical Management of Traumatic Brain Injury . I have lectured widely on the topic. Also, I am interested in and have published on the use of novel devices and techniques for the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases, including brain aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations Neurosurgery is a personal and collaborative effort that allows patients to return to their productive and satisfying lives as quickly and as safely as possible.
