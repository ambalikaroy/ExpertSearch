At NYU Langones Heart Rhythm Center , I treat people who have conditions that affect their heart rhythm, including those that cause the heart to beat too fast, like atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, or those that cause the heart to beat too slow and require treatment with a pacemaker. The technology we use in electrophysiology is always advancing, from mapping systems that allow us to understand each persons distinct heart rhythm to the catheters we use for ablation therapy, a treatment that stops abnormal electrical activity in the heart. We are recognized leaders in our field, which means that we are involved with the development of and have access to the latest technologies. This helps us to deliver the best possible care to our patients. One of the most satisfying aspects of my job is identifying why someone has an abnormal heart rhythm, pinpointing the problem, and fixing it. There is often a moment during a procedure when I know weve achieved a successful outcome for the patient. Its incredibly gratifying to be able to help someone. After patients have recovered from their procedures, they can often be more active, but the benefits go beyond thatnot experiencing the symptoms of abnormal heart rhythm allows them to focus on and be engaged in other areas of their lives.
