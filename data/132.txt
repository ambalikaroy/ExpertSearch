 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me When patients come to see me at the Heart Rhythm Center , I take the time to get to know them. My goal is to learn how heart rhythm disorders impact their everyday lives and how frequently they experience symptoms. This is all valuable information for the first step of the treatment journey: providing an accurate diagnosis. Aizer_bio_v3 Video Player is loading.

We use advanced technology, such as electroanatomic mapping, to create a three-dimensional image of the heart. We then use this to pinpoint the source of a persons abnormal rhythm and develop an individualized treatment plan. For people with atrial fibrillation, care might include catheter ablation to stop abnormal signals in the heart and restore a persons normal heart rhythm. I also use multiple types of left atrial appendage occlusion devices that prevent clots from forming in the hearts of people with atrial fibrillation. This reduces the risk of both stroke and life-threatening bleeding. For people with cardiac sarcoidosis, I design treatment strategies to determine the risk of abnormal heart rhythms and then treat my patients as needed with pacemakers, defibrillators, or ablation therapies. Having a heart procedure can be stressful, and the best way to help people feel better is to listen to them. I take the time to address each persons questions and concerns. I enjoy connecting with my patients on a personal levelmaking sure they are informed and feel heard. My work allows me to take what Ive learned and help people in a very profound way. With the right treatment, I can change their lives. They cant believe it, and their reactions are always heartwarming to me.

I study the effects of lifestyle choices on the development of atrial fibrillation, as well as novel catheter ablation strategies to cure atrial fibrillation. Other research includes optimizing ICD implantation and programming to maximize patient survival and quality of life. In addition, my researchfocuses on ways to prevent sudden death form life-threatening arrhythmias in cardiac sarcoidosis.
