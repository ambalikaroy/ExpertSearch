 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials News About Me From a young age, I was interested in medicine and helping people. I chose my speciality of cardiothoracic surgery because I have the opportunity to make a tremendous difference not only in the survival but in the quality of a persons life. I use surgery to treatdiseases of the heart and lungs. Some of the procedures I perform include, but are not limited to, coronary artery bypass surgery, treatment of valvular heart disease with open surgeries, and minimally invasive and percutaneous approaches. I also provide treatments for collapsed lungs and lung resections for cancer, tumors, or infections. My team and I are dedicated to each patients health and wellbeing. Every patient we see has individual concerns and needs, which is why we develop tailored treatment plans. I take the time to discuss each patients options for treatment and establish a care plan that they can understand and trust. I have participated in a variety of research trials for percutaneous aortic valve replacement and percutaneous mitral valve replacement. I am a member of several professional societies including The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, the American Medical Association, The Medical Society of the State of New York, and the Nassau County Medical Society. I am a fellow of the American College of Surgeons. For the past several years I have been recognized by Castle Connollys Regional Top Doctorsas well as Newsday s listing of Long Islands Top Doctors. I have been the chief of cardiac surgery at NYU Winthrop Hospital since 2015.
