 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me During my middle school years, I was fortunate to have a role model who received great satisfaction from caring for patients in his office and operating roommy father. During summers in college, I worked with him in the operating room as a trained surgical technician. My practice, part of Perlmutter Cancer Center ,is restricted to diseases and surgery of the breast. These patients include women at high risk for developing breast cancer, those with benign conditions that warrant surgery to rule out breast cancer, and those with breast cancer. I was one of two surgeons offering breast conservation to patients on Long Island in the mid to late 1980s. At NYU Winthrop Hospital , I performed one of the first axillary sentinel lymph node biopsies for breast cancer on Long Island. This procedure significantly reduces the incidence of lymphedema. My team and I have worked together for 40 years. We help our patients with breast cancer to navigate the whirlwind of scheduling all appointments in preparation for surgery. Our practice also offers the SAVI SCOUT preoperative localization procedure for abnormal breast imaging biopsies. We work with the NYU Winthrop breast team, which consists of specialists in radiation oncology, medical oncology, and plastic surgery, as well as a social worker and nurse navigator. The cooperative effort of our NYU Winthrop breast team has enabled our patients to navigate more easily through a very stressful journey.
