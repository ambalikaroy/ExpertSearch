 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me As a cardiologist specializing in advanced heart failure care, I primarily treat people who have heart failure or other advanced cardiac diseases, such as cardiac amyloidosis and sarcoidosis. I was drawn to the specialty of heart failure because I enjoy dealing with the complexities of care in patients with life threatening conditions. Video Player is loading.

At NYU Langones Heart Failure Advanced Care Center , we specialize in providing care to people who have been unable to receive sufficient response to treatment or understanding about their condition elsewhere. I take great pride in being able to provide these patients with answers and hope. As an immigrant and New York resident, I know the citys various communities well and have made it a mission of our heart failure program to bring them specialized cardiac care. In addition to our Manhattan location, we have six offices in other boroughs that bring advanced heart failure care closer to home for many patients. At each location, we have a board-certified advanced heart failure specialist to determine the optimal treatment plan for each person. Patient care is a partnership between doctor and patient to provide individualized treatment. Because of the advanced and critical nature of my patients illnesses, I need to be honest and realistic when discussing their prognosis and setting their expectations. My goal is to help them understand their condition and what their future looks like. I dedicate a large portion of time to helping people and their families navigate difficult decisions. I am the clinical director of heart failure at NYU Langone and the medical director of our heart transplant program and Ventricular Assist Device Program , where we offer lifesaving, mechanical devices that assist the heart. I also provide medical care to people who need heart transplantation at our Transplant Institute . Currently, I am involved in clinical trials testing novel therapeutics and device therapy to treat heart failure.
