 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me My interest in medicine began during a mission trip to Mexico with my church. I shadowed the doctors on the team and witnessed the life-changing impact of their compassionate care. I realized I wanted to pursue a career that allows me to provide service to those in need. I became interested in breast surgery during the early years of my surgery residency training. I am thrilled that the continued efforts in this field to challenge past and current practices and to utilize new techniques consistently improves outcomes for women with breast disease. I specialize in the treatment and care of patients with breast cancer as well as those who have benign conditions that warrant surgery. I also evaluate and care for patients who are at increased risk of developing breast cancer due to genetic mutations or a history of high-risk lesions discovered through biopsy. I perform breast-conserving surgery, or lumpectomy, as well as mastectomy, including skin-sparing and nipple-sparing mastectomy. I routinely perform sentinel lymph node biopsy for axillary staging in patients with early-stage breast cancer. I believe in practicing evidence-based medicine and following the most up-to-date guidelines to provide the highest standard of care. I also believe the patient and physician should be a team and always have informed discussions during treatment planning to develop an individualized plan together. I treat each patient as a whole person; I dont just manage the disease. Receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer can be devastating, and I am dedicated to providing comprehensive care with compassion. My team and I at NYU Langone HospitalLong Island strive to deliver the highest quality care with empathy. We also facilitate navigation of the health system and our multidisciplinary teams. I am a member of the American Society of Breast Surgeons and the Society of Surgical Oncology and a fellow of the American College of Surgeons.
