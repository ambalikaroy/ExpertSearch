 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me My love of science, coupled with my caring and nurturing disposition, made a career in medicine a natural choice. I fell in love with cardiology specifically, for its exciting innovations that have an immediate impact on peoples lives. Education has always been a top priority for my family, and as a physician, I am excited to have a career that allows me to continuously learn and improve the lives of my patients. I treat patients who have cardiac problems, ranging from hypertension to acute heart attacks. I also specialize in interventional procedures for coronary artery disease, such as coronary angiography and complex coronary interventions. I treat patients as people firstI take the time to learn about their families and personal lives, which frequently play a role in the progress of their health. My personal motto is, If its not broken, dont fix it. I emphasize preventive care and only intervene when there is a significant problem.
