 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me I graduated summa cum laude from both my bachelor of science degree and masters degree in biomedical engineering programs at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, where I later graduated as valedictorian of my medical class. After a general surgery internship and orthopedic surgery residency here at the Hospital for Joint Diseasesnow NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital I completed a fellowship in adult reconstruction and total joint replacement surgery at Brigham and Womens Hospital, a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. My practice at NYU Langone focuses specifically on caring for people with hip and knee conditions. I have a particular interest in degenerative joint disease of the hips and knees. Other areas of focus include treatment for people with developmental hip dysplasia, avascular necrosis, posttraumatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. I have had the privilege to train and learn from the founders of the field of joint replacement surgery. I have gained a vast amount of experience in performing complex and revision hip and knee surgery, partial knee replacement, ligament-sparing knee surgery, hip resurfacing, and hip fracture surgery. I use patient-specific implants, robotic and navigation surgery, and minimally invasive surgical techniques for hip and knee replacements to ensure that patients achieve the results they expect in order to maintain their lifestyle and activity levels.
