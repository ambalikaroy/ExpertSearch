Early in my career, I spent several years training in Paris under the direction of Professor Alain Carpentier, the inventor of mitral valve repair techniques and tissue valve prostheses. While there, I performed the worlds first robotic mitral valve repair with Professor Carpentier in May 1998 and the worlds first endoscopic robotic coronary artery bypass grafting in June 1998. Since then, I have performed thousands of mitral valve repair procedures using conventional, minimally invasive, or robotic approaches. I determine the best surgical approach for each patient, based on their unique diagnosis and treatment needs. Robotic surgery is often the preferred approach because it is the most precise and least invasive. I am proud to be part of the robotic cardiac surgery team at NYU Langone. These procedures require a dedicated team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nurses who are specially trained in robotic heart surgery. We have extensive experience in providing the highest level of care that results in the best outcomes. I am honored to be recognized by New York Magazine in its listing of The 100 Top Minimally Invasive Surgeons and the Best Doctors in New York. Ive also been named in Castle Connollys Americas Top Doctors series for the last 15 years. I am a member of many national and international professional societies, including The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, the International Society for Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery, and the Heart Valve Society.
