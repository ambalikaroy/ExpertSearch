 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations About Me Most of my family is in the healthcare profession, so I was raised in an environment where helping and caring for others was the norm. Because I always had an affinity for the elderly population, the field of geriatrics was a natural choice. I strive to provide comprehensive and compassionate care for the elderly to optimize their health and quality of life. My patients typically have multiple chronic and progressive illnesses. Many also face financial or social support challenges that limit or prevent them from thriving in the community setting. I am part of a nursing home and rehabilitation center where a multidisciplinary approach is utilized to guide each patients care. Additionally, I am the associate medical director for NYU Winthrop Hospital s Transitions of Care Program. I work closely with both the nursing home and the hospital to help create more seamless transitions to and from each institution. I belong to the New York Medical Directors Association and the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.
