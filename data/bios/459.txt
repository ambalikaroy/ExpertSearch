 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me From a very young age, I knew that I wanted to be a doctor. Because I was raised by strong women, I knew that I wanted to be a doctor that primarily took care of women.In medical school, I discovered that I enjoyed being in the operating room and found gynecologic surgery and, specifically, gynecologic oncology to be a natural career choice. As a gynecologic oncologist at NYU Langones Perlmutter Cancer Center , I care for people who have cancer and other diseases of the female reproductive tract. I perform robotic minimally invasive surgery and fertility-sparing surgery, a type of treatment that helps younger women preserve fertility following cancer treatment. I take a patient-centric approach to care. I provide treatment recommendations based on best practices but make sure all decisions involve the patient. I also use a holistic approach, focusing on not just a patients condition, but on all factors affecting a womans health, such as her family situation, mental health, and nutritional needs. I train and mentor medical students and residents. My research interests include examining how various aspects of gynecologic cancer affect young adults and members of the LGBTQ+ community. My translational research has focused on finding targeted treatment for the management of different types of gynecologic cancer. I am a member of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO). As part of the SGO, I am a member of the Foundation for Womens Cancer Patient Education Committee and have worked on organizing the SGOs annual Allied Health Professionals Meeting. I was awarded the Ovarinnavate: Ovarcome Research Excellence Award by the Foundation for Womens Cancer in 2017 and the Chairmans Award for Excellence in Clinical Research at the end of my fellowship.
