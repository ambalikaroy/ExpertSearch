I have published more than 50 articles. For more than 15 years, I have studied the biology of cancer and I am a National Institutes of Healthfunded investigator. My lab work focuses on understanding the biology of pancreatic cancer. In particular, we focus on the unique metabolism of these cancers to understand how they use various fuel sources to power their growth. By targeting the way pancreatic cancers use fuel and create building blocks for growth, we hope to be able to develop novel therapeutic approaches. My research is paving the way for multiple clinical trials that will involve the testing of these new therapies. I serve on the editorial boards of several leading scientific journals, and my own research has been published in some of these journals. These include Cancer Cell, Cancer Discovery, Cell, Genes & Development, Nature, and Science . Ive received numerous honors and awards, including election to the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Ruth Leff Siegel Award for Excellence in Pancreatic Cancer Research from Columbia Universitys Department of Surgery. This award is given to the researcher who has made the most significant contribution to pancreatic cancer research.
