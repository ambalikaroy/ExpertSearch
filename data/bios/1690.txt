I now serve as the director of the Adult ADHD Program , where I treat adults who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I also help manage associated conditions, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorder. I work with a team that provides evaluations, diagnoses, medications, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Every one of us is focused on finding a treatment that fits each person. There have been tremendous advances in our understanding of ADHD and other psychiatric disorders during the last decade. My own research examines ways to evaluate and treat people who have ADHD, such as by using new assessment tools, medications, and psychotherapies. Some people who come to my practice are in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. For a long time, they have felt like something was wrong in their lives, but they didnt know what it was. After a diagnosis, they often are flooded with feelingsrelief that they finally understand what is happening, but also regret about not having been evaluated earlier. I want patients to know that help is always available, no matter how long they have been experiencing symptoms of ADHD. We can only move forward. Today, we have very effective treatments available that can improve quality of life.
