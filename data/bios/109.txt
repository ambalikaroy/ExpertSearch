 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me During my more than 20 years as a cardiothoracic surgeon, I have performed the most complex surgeries for people with a broad variety of cardiovascular and lung diseases. I have developed expertise in the most technically challenging procedures, including coronary artery bypass grafting, total arterial revascularization, beating heart techniques, and valve-sparing aortic aneurysm repair, which allows for preservation of the aortic valve.

I am the chief of thoracic surgery at NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn and provide care to people in Brooklyn and Manhattan. I perform the full range of thoracic surgical procedures. Most major lung cancer procedures are done through small incisions, using minimally invasive approaches and the latest advances in medical technology. This makes recovery faster and easier for my patients. I became interested in biological sciences at a very early age. Witnessing my father, a chairman of surgery, perform the most difficult operations was one of the pivotal early experiences that sparked my desire to become a surgeon. Cardiothoracic surgery is especially appealing to me because it combines deep knowledge of basic science and physiology, mental and physical endurance, and sharp technical skills. It allows me to create strategies for providing care to people who have complex conditions, while at the same time making immediate, lifesaving decisions during surgery. I am extremely proud to be working with an exceptional team of healthcare professionals who always deliver the best care for my patients. We use a personalized approach to treat difficult conditions with the goal of achieving the best results. I have published numerous manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals on various aspects of cardiothoracic surgery and I am currently involved in clinical outcomes research.
