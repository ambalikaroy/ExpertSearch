The majority of surgeries I perform are minimally invasive procedures for musculoskeletal injuries and conditions involving the shoulder, elbow, and knee. I repair rotator cuff tears and perform anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions using small incisions and arthroscopic techniques that allow patients to return to activities quickly. My team at NYU Langone Orthopedic Center offers a unique, diversified approach to treatment. Were comprised of specialists and surgeons, all trained in minimally invasive surgery, and top-rated musculoskeletal radiologists who use advanced imaging technology, including MRI and ultrasound. We also have a state-of-the-art physical therapy center, and an electronic medical record system that allows me to monitor my patients progress. We like to think of ourselves as a one-stop-shopping facility, with most of our surgeries being performed under the same roof with unparalleled continuity of care. Given these resources, I can provide individualized, comprehensive evaluation and treatment to my patients. Orthopedic surgery is a field in which the advancements are ever expanding, and the way we do things is constantly changing and improving. In addition to my clinical care, I conduct research on treatment outcomes to ensure that people are provided with the best and newest options. My writing has been widely published, and Ive received awards for my clinical practice and research. I am a long-standing member of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and the American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine. I am also proud to have served as the team physician for the New York Mets from 2001 to 2004.
