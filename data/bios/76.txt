 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me My practice and research are directed at providing the most effective surgical treatment for patients with cancer of the breast, malignant melanoma and related malignances of the skin and soft tissues, and thyroid cancer, as well as for those with thyroid and parathyroid disease. I integrate advances in radiologic imaging and pathologic diagnosis, molecular and genetic analyses, plastic and reconstructive techniques, and adjunctive therapies when planning and performing surgery. I have been a principal investigator of the National Cancer Institute Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial, which has led to sentinel node biopsy being the standard of care for patients with malignant melanoma and breast cancer. I direct the Shifrin-Myers Breast Cancer Discovery Fund and the Cancer Surgery Research Fund. I have been a clinical fellow of the American Cancer Society and have served as New York State chairman of the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons and the president of the New York Surgical Society. I have also served on active duty as Lieutenant Commander with the Medical Corps of the U.S. Navy. I received the Solomon A. Berson Alumni Achievement Award in Clinical Science from NYU School of Medicine, the Excellence in Medicine Award from the Israel Cancer Research Fund, the Physician of the Year Award from the Rambam Medical Center in Israel, the Humanitarian Award from the Melanoma Research Foundation, the Manhattan Breast Cancer Awareness Award, and the Gender Equality Award from the American Medical Womens Association. My publications include two major textbooks Breast Cancer and Diagnosis and Management of Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma . I am a member of the American Surgical Association, the Society of Surgical Oncology, the American Association for Cancer Research, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. It is often said that to practice good medicine, one has to teach good medicine. NYU Langone has given me this opportunity. I am honored to have been the recipient of the Great Teacher Award from New York University and a five-time recipient of the Distinguished Teacher Award from NYU School of Medicine. Above all, I have been honored to be at an institution that enables me to deliver compassionate, state-of-the-art medical care and which honors its mission to advance medicine through research and education. I have worked with inspiring mentors and continue to work with outstanding colleagues. But my patientswith their determination and dedicationhave always been my greatest source of inspiration.
