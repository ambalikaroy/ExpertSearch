 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me Medicine has intrigued me since I was a young adult.

Coming from a family of doctors and medical professionals also gave me access to the world of medicinea world that continues to grow, evolve, and satisfy my curiosities. I initially became interested in spine surgery as a specialty when my father had multiple procedures for the treatment of recurring lower back problems. Seeing the immediate, positive results of surgery inspired me to specialize in the field. I keep up with recent advancements in spine surgeryoffering less invasive procedures and surgical techniques that preserve range of motionwhile delivering the highest level of care to patients. I always aim to perform the least amount of surgery that offers the best possible long-term outcome. I work with a team of talented specialists who are dedicated to restoring patients quality of life. In everything we dofrom treatment to researchour patients interests come first. My clinical research focuses on treatment outcomes for adults who have degenerative conditions of the spine and conditions that cause life-altering deformities. More than 80 of my research publications and findings have been presented at national and international conferences.
