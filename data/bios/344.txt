 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I was inspired to pursue medicine when I realized it was the best way to combine my interest in science with my desire to help others. As the medical director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center , I specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and in endoscopic procedures such as colonoscopy, chromoendoscopy, capsule endoscopy, and upper endoscopy.

I chose to specialize in the treatment and care of people with inflammatory bowel disease, which primarily includes Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis, because this was an area of medicine in which I felt I could make a significant and meaningful difference for my patients and in the overall advancement of research and science. Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic condition, so I have the privilege of caring for my patients for long periods of time. This allows me to develop strong, long-term relationships. Getting to know my patients in this way and helping them to become and remain healthy are my favorite parts of being a physician. At the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centerat NYU Langone, we believe its important not only to treat the disease but also to care for the whole person. This is why we work in partnership with our patientsto ensure they receive the most effective treatment and care. We provide the latest advances in treatment options, as well as the coordination of nutrition, support groups, acupuncture, surgery (if needed), and other services to ensure that the comprehensive care we provide helps improve all aspects of peoples lives. Inflammatory bowel disease represents a complex interaction between genetics, gut bacteria, the bodys immune system, and the environment. My research focuses on promising new treatment options for people with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis. Im also looking at the role of the gut microbiome in the potential prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of these diseases.
