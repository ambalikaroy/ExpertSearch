 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me I grew up in Syria, and as a young child, I worked in a pharmacy with my father and helped package medications for delivery to villages around our town. This gave me an early interest in medicine, and the love for my family and community inspired me to pursue a career where I could help others. I was drawn to the specialty of oncology because it was an emerging field at that time with many exciting developments. I was fascinated by the complexities of cancer and lucky to be trained under great mentors, including a distinguished oncologist from Argentina. He guided me and put me on the path that I am on today. As a medical oncologist and hematologist who has been practicing for more than 30 years, I treat all types of cancer, though I specialize in treating different types of blood cancer and gastrointestinal cancer. Having practiced for so many years, I am well-known for the quality of care that I provide. I believe in open communication and presenting my patients and their families with the right data that helps them make informed choices about their treatment. As director of medical oncology at NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn , I oversee all cancer care at the hospital. I work with a compassionate team of medical oncologists, nurses, and other specialists who offer the latest cancer treatments in a comfortable setting at Perlmutter Cancer CenterSunset Park . We believe in treating our patients with the highest standards of care and providing comprehensive services that are conveniently located in their home borough, Brooklyn. This improves the quality of care we offer and also improves quality of life for our patients. My goal is to not only provide the best treatment to patients, but to establish a good screening program for early detection and hopefully, in the future, for prevention as well.
