 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me From a young age, I had a passion for helping people in times of need, which made medicine the ideal career choice for me. I was particularly drawn to the specialty of orthopedic surgery because Im interested in promoting health and wellness by maintaining an active lifestyle. Growing up playing multiple sports, I learned the myriad of challenges that musculoskeletal injuries can inflict on people and their daily lives. This has informed the greaterpersonal understanding I have of my patients and their conditions. I care for people who have various foot and ankle problems, including ankle sprains, flatfoot deformity, bunions, and complex fractures. I work in collaboration with my patients to fully understand their goals and determine the best treatment plan to achieve their desired results. In addition to treating foot and ankle fractures, tendon injuries, and deformity corrections, I specialize in performing total ankle replacements for arthritis, as well as cartilage restoration procedures of the ankle. I am a member of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society, and American Osteopathic Academy of Orthopedics.
