 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I am the medical director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy CenterSleep Center , treating people with epilepsy and sleep disorders using electroencephalography (EEG) and video-EEG monitoring. I am board certified in neurology, clinical neurophysiology, and sleep medicine. My research focuses on the effect of seizures and epilepsy on sleep. I have written multiple articles and book chapters related to distinguishing seizures that occur while a person is awake from those that occur during sleep. I have also written about differentiating between a sleep disorder and a seizure. I collaborate with the National Institutes of Health on several projects related to sleep and neurodevelopment. As an assistant professor of neurology at NYU School of Medicine, I have helped train residents and fellows in the use of EEG as well as in epilepsy treatment and evidence-based sleep medicine, so we can meet patients specific needs. I am an honorary member of the Spanish Society of Neurology, helping to organize and teach an annual sleep medicine course for general practitioners, residents, and fellows. I have been invited to lecture nationally and internationally, and I am currently the vice chair of the Lifelong Learning Development Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. I am proud to have served as a major in the U.S. Army Reserve for eight years during my medical career.
