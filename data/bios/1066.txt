 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I became an ophthalmologist because restoring sight has a significant impact on peoples quality of life and increases their independence. As a trained ophthalmologist, I enjoy treating people who have retinal conditions and surgically restoring their vision. My patients have a variety of eye diseases, including macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal tears, holes, and dystrophies. I perform retinal surgeries, including pars plana vitrectomy, retinal detachment repair, macular hole repair, and epiretinal membrane peel. I offer people the latest treatments and use the most advanced imaging system to assist in providing treatment. I enjoy interacting with my patients and building long-term relationships. I aim to educate them about their conditions and when possible, offer them choices in their care. When people come to me, I provide a customized care plan to restore or maintain their sight. My practice is also efficient and accommodating in treating people who have ocular emergencies. I am a certified investigator for the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, and an investigator in a variety of clinical research at NYU Winthrop Hospital , part of NYU Langone Health. Part of my professional duty is to be informed of the latest medical and surgical advances so I can offer them to our patients.
