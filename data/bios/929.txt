As a neurosurgeon specializing in brain tumors, I treat most varieties of benign and cancerous tumors that can occur in the brain. Im a Mr. Fix It kind of guy by nature, so I love the technical aspects, investigative work, and the dedication that my job demands. Ive devoted a good part of my career to researching neurofibromatosis type 2, a genetic disease that causes complex tumors to grow in the brain and spinal cord. These tumors affect the nerves responsible for hearing and balance. Those of us working in the Department of Neurosurgery are also at the forefront of stereotactic surgery, which enables us to view critical pathways of the brain through a microscope during surgery, locate a tumor, and determine more precisely which areas to remove. I want my patients to have the same knowledge of their surgery as I do, because the unfamiliar is scary. I love that patients come to us expecting a perfect outcome, because were going to do everything we can to get as close to it as possible.
