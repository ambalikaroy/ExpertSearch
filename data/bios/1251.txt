After training in different areas of the country, I knew I wanted to return to care for people here. New York City is such a melting pot, and our patients have such varied backgrounds. Im grateful to be able to connect with each and every person who comes here for treatment. Im also fortunate to have a great team working with me at the NYU Langone Orthopedic Center , from my office staff to the nurses in the operating room to the physical therapists. We are all committed to doing what is best for each patient, whether that is surgery, nonsurgical treatment, counseling, or physical therapy. We have pioneered several orthopedic procedures at NYU Langonefor example, 30 years ago we were the first to perform total hip replacement surgery. We were also the first to implement the use of a different type of anesthesia for people who have knee procedures. This particular method of nonnarcotic pain relief helps accelerate recovery and allows patients to return home the day after surgery. We dont only care for patientswe also conduct research. This gives us a fantastic ability to learn new techniques and ask questions that can benefit people everywhere. I focus my research on quality of care, treatment outcomes, and patient safety, particularly in regard to infection control.
