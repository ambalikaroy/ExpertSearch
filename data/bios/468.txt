 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me A Jamaican-born immigrant, I became a doctor to change the face of medicine and to eliminate health disparities, especially the disparity that persists in maternal mortality. I use the resources of a large academic center to deliver the specialized care needed for my ethnically diverse patients at NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn . The word doctor is derived from the Latin word docere, which means to teach, and I take that role very seriously. Ive received teaching accolades and awards from our residents and pride myself in not only shaping the future of medicine, but in communicating with my patients in their preferred language and style to ensure they are informed participants in their care. As high-risk pregnancy specialists, we care for mothers during the most precious, vulnerable, and sometimes scariest time of their lives, which may involve detailed fetal ultrasounds, evidence-based consultations for conditions that may affect maternal health, and pregnancy complications. I have a special interest in ultrasound-diagnosed fetal abnormalities, diabetes, preterm birth, and preeclampsia. I also perform diagnostic genetic procedures, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis. I have participated in research concerning the clinical role of ultrasound in placenta accreta spectrum disorders, preterm birth, and genetic screening tests during pregnancy. Also, I was awarded the fellow research award from the New York Perinatal Society. It is my privilege to care for women and their unborn children.
