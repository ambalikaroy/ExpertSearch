 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials About Me I am a board-certified dermatologist specializing in medical dermatology. I manage numerous skin conditions in both adults and children, ranging from skin cancer and acne to psoriasis and eczema. I have a special interest in hidradenitis suppurativa, a condition that causes painful draining boils and scar formation in skin folds. I collaborate with other hidradenitis suppurativa specialists at NYU Langone and have created a hidradenitis suppurativa specialty clinic at the Skin and Cancer Unit of the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology. This clinic focuses on providing comprehensive multidisciplinary care for this difficult-to-manage condition. In addition, I am participating in numerous research projects, including clinical trials, in the hopes of finding better treatment options for patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. I am also interested in complex medical dermatology and comanage the inpatient dermatology service at NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn , where I have the privilege of caring for hospitalized patients with severe skin disease. I was born in Doncaster, England, and raised in upstate New York. I received my medical degree from the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York and graduated magna cum laude. During medical school, I was nominated by my peers into the Gold Humanism Honor Societyan honor awarded to role model providers who embody exceptional clinical care, compassion, human connection, dedication to service, and community involvement. In addition, I received the John Paroski, MD, Memorial Award for compassion and excellence in patient care. I went on to complete an internal medicine intern year at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital in Boston. I subsequently completed a dermatology residency at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester and had the privilege of serving as a chief dermatology resident in my final year. My training provided a strong foundation not only in medicine and dermatology, but also in caring for patients from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. My goal is to ensure that all my patients feel safe, heard, and well cared for. Credentials Positions Assistant Professor, Ronald O.
