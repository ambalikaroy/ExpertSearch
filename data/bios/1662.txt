 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research About Me During my youth, I was always very active and athletic and experienced injuries. Each time, I marveled at my doctors ability to treat my injuries. These early experiences sparked my interest in becoming a physician. As a podiatrist at NYU Langone, I treat patients who have a variety of conditions, including diabetic foot disease with ulcerations and infection, bunion and hammertoe deformities, toenail pathologies, flatfoot deformities, osteoarthritic and rheumatologic disease of the foot and ankle, and overuse injuries of tendons, joints, and bones. I perform reconstructive foot surgery in an operating room setting. In my office, I offer platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, which help patients heal by using their own blood cells. I use this procedure to help with the healing of chronic and resistant degenerative changes of tendons, ligaments, and joints. I believe in a conservative treatment approach for foot and ankle conditions. I consider surgical treatments only if a more conservative therapy does not work. Surgery should always be considered a last resort. Less is more in many instances. Our bodies have an amazing capacity to fix themselves that is second to none. When patients come to me with injuries, I try to provide care that gives their bodies the ability to heal themselves. I believe that it is my job to provide people with the proper support and direction so that they can achieve their goal of pain-free movement with as little medication and as few invasive procedures as possible. In addition to providing clinical care, I am currently gathering information and exploring a potential research paper focused on PRP treatment for ailments of the foot and ankle.
