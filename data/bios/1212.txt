 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me I first become interested in medicine when I was 12 years old. My father took me to an orthopedic surgeon, where I received a scoliosis diagnosis. The experience made me appreciate the enormous effect spine conditions have on children and adults and inspired me to become a doctor. I specialize in the surgical and nonsurgical treatment of mild, moderate, and severe scoliosis, spina bifida, spine injuries in athletes, and a variety of other spine conditions at NYU Langone Orthopedic SurgeryRutherford Place , NYU Langone Ambulatory Care Bay Ridge , and NYU Langone HJD Clinical Neurophysiology Associates . I also provide surgical treatment to children at Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital34th Street . My personal experience drives my commitment to improving the quality of life of young people with scoliosis. I am particularly interested in helping children with early onset scoliosis who are still growing by using innovative technology such as the magnetic spine lengthening device. This advanced device eliminates the need for repeated surgeriesevery six to nine monthsin growing children. When surgery is necessary, I consider less invasive techniques, such as anterior vertebral body tethering, that improve quality of life. I am one of the top, internationally known surgeons in this nonfusion surgical technique that partially restrains one side of the spine with a cord, instead of with a traditional rod. This allows the other side of the spine to straighten as it grows. Recovery is faster compared with surgical techniques that fuse the spine, and patients can usually go back to their regular activities in six weeks. This approach also allows for more freedom of movement. My research focuses on early onset scoliosis surgery, nonfusion techniques that improve the care of young people with scoliosis, and the biomechanics of the spine, which is how all the spines components contribute to its stability. I am a member of the Pediatric Spine Study Group and both a member and part of the research committee of the Scoliosis Research Society.
