 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me Growing up as the daughter of an obstetrician and gynecologist, I always wanted to follow in my fathers footsteps. My fondest memories are of when I accompanied my father to the hospital and witnessed the care and devotion he had for all his patients. This furthered my interest in helping people, and ultimately, I chose to specialize in maternalfetal medicine. I see women with medical and obstetric complications of pregnancy, which can place both the patient and baby at risk. I most often treat people who have maternal cardiac disease, renal disease, hypertension, diabetes, recurrent loss, lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and those who have had organ transplants. I also provide preconception and obstetric care for patients with high-risk pregnancy. I work with a compassionate team of nurses and specialists to provide the safest and highest quality obstetric care. NYU Winthrop Hospital , part of NYU Langone Health, is one of the few places that has a fetal surgery program. I have particular expertise in perinatal safety and I work as the hospital patient safety officer to enhance quality and safety initiatives. I am also an active member of the New York Obstetrical Society and the Safe Motherhood Initiative through the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. In addition to serving as a physician and educator, I conduct research on identifying unknown risk factors for obstetrical hemorrhage. My goal is to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, while striving towards the best possible obstetrical outcomes for patients.
