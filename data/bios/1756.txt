Along with my colleagues, I am working to develop new agents and procedures to minimize the side effects of radiation. We currently have a partial breast protocol that offers a shortened, one-week course of radiation for select breast cancer patients. As the associate program director of our radiation oncology residency program, I am actively involved and invested in training the next generation of radiation oncologists. Communication is at the core of all our work. We are focused on making the medicine and science of radiation oncology accessible to our patients, to help them make informed decisions at every stage of treatment. We listen closely to our patients so we can understand what they are experiencing and the unique values and goals that shape that experience. We are in constant contact with medical and surgical oncologists, and together, we provide seamless, comprehensive care. Our clinical care is informed by collaboration with researchers and clinicians at NYU Langone and around the world. I serve as a council member on the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group and am also a member of the breast committee of NRG Oncology, a nonprofit organization dedicated to clinical research. We are learning every dayfrom colleagues, scientists, and most importantly, from our patientsand drawing upon that knowledge and sharing it with others to provide the highest level of care. It is that combination of learning and listening, collaborating and creating, and providing the best that medicine has to offer while putting our patients at the center of our work, that defines who we are and what we do.
