 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me Im a cardiothoracic surgeon at NYU Langones Heart Valve Center , where I specialize in providing surgical care to patients who have heart valve disease. I am also part of the team that performs lung transplantation and heart transplantation at our Transplant Institute . Caring for people who have heart conditions is very gratifying. Because of advances in cardiac surgery, Im able to provide treatments for people with a variety of heart ailments, helping them live longer and more fulfilling lives. When possible, I use minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), that result in less pain and a shorter recovery time for my patients. I also specialize in all forms of cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting, atrial fibrillation surgery, heart failure surgery, aortic surgery, and myectomy to treat people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Additionally, I am trained in robotic cardiac surgery.
