 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me I decided to pursue a career in medicine because I wanted to help people. I chose my specialty of pediatric orthopedic surgery because I have the opportunity to provide care that will improve peoples lives. My pediatric patients range from newborns to young adults. I treat a range of conditions, from congenital deformities to traumatic injuries. I am fortunate to work alongside a dedicated and professional staff that has a long history of treating children. Together, our experience gives us the ability to foresee problems and address questions when a child is injured. We develop treatment plans that not only address current problems, but also consider the future implications for a growing bone. I form close relationships with patients and their families and listen to their concerns. We discuss treatment options and choose which plan has the best chance of generating the best predictable outcomes. When explaining treatment plans to disappointed children, I help them focus on their goal of getting better so they can get back to doing what they enjoy. I am involved in a number of research studies, including the treatment and prevention of traumatic injuries in pediatric patients, overuse injuries in children, and quality of care in the pediatric patient. I am proud to be a fellow of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery. I am a member of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America, the Pediatric Club of New York, and the Nassau Surgical Society. I was named attending of the year at NYU Winthrop University Hospital.
