 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me Medicine was a welcome surprise for me when I was an undergraduate student trying to find a career that suited me. I loved and excelled in all my science classes, but it wasnt until I volunteered at a hospital and shadowed various healthcare workers, that I realized the impact of practicing medicineit transformed my life. I knew that I wanted to dedicate my life to making a difference in peoples lives. My training is a gift that I appreciate to this very day, even after many years in practice. Every patient interaction is a unique opportunity to touch someones life. Whether its treatment, education, or just reassurance that I can provide, its a privilege to provide the care my patients deserve. I am fellowship trained in both orthopedic oncology and pediatric orthopedics. In my practice, I see patients with bone and soft tissue tumors and sarcomas in pediatric and adult populations. I also see general pediatric orthopedic patients with various fractures and deformities of the limbs and spine, such as scoliosis. In my practice, I offer various surgical procedures addressing the various challenges that my patients face. I offer limb-sparing surgical resection and reconstruction for tumors, sarcomas, and metastatic bone disease. I also provide fracture fixation for pediatric trauma and complex surgeries for correction of deformities, and both operative and nonoperative treatment of scoliosis in the pediatric population. I approach each patient with compassionate and attentive care. I want to present myself not only as a knowledgeable specialist, but as an empathic physician who can provide and educate patients and their families regarding up-to-date, evidence-based standards of care for the ailments they may face. While there may be many diseases, fractures, or deformities that have standardized care and guidelines for treatment, every patient is unique. I think patients feel more comfortable and optimistic about some of the decisions they face when they are well-informed and educated about their health challenges. As a surgical subspecialist with extensive training and experience, I can provide these essential elements along with the standard and sometimes complex surgical care that they need. Currently, I am involved with clinical research in pediatric orthopedic care and musculoskeletal tumors, both benign and malignant.
