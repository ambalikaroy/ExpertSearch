 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations About Me Some of my fondest childhood memories are of my pediatricians calm and comforting demeanor. As a child, I wanted to become a pediatrician to provide the same compassionate care to children that he provided to my brother and me. I am incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to take care of my patients from birth to adolescence, providing them with a comfortable environment in which to receive care. At Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone , I provide preventive care and guidance as it relates to growth, nutrition, and developmental milestones for babies and children through adolescence. I diagnose, treat, and manage most childhood infections and common ailments. Additionally, I provide counseling on behavior and sleep. I cherish the bonds that I form with my patients and their families. Each routine checkup is an opportunity to teach children and their parents about health, and a chance for me to learn more about them. I aim to offer all children the same attentive, warm, and sensitive care that I would want my own children to receive. I had the privilege of growing up in an Italian home and studying in Mexico and am proud to be able to communicate with families in Italian and Spanish, in addition to English. I love the diversity of New York City and am honored to serve its children and their families at NYU Langone.
