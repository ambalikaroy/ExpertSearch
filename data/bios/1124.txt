 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me During medical school, I watched surgeons help patients who were experiencing painful and life-altering conditions, and I realized how immediate and positive the impact of orthopedic surgery could be. Most patients were feeling better within days of their procedure and reached full recovery within weeks or months. Twenty-six years ago I decided to specialize in orthopedic surgery and have never second-guessed that decision. William Macaulay, MD William Macaulay Bio Video Video Player is loading.

As an orthopedic surgeon at NYU Langone, I specialize in primary and revision total hip and knee replacement, as well as partial knee replacement, hip resurfacing surgery, hip fracture repair, and knee arthroscopy. We first evaluate peoples conditions and consider nonsurgical options. If theres a less invasive way to effectively treat my patients, I choose that route. But if surgery is the best treatment available at a given point in time, I do not hesitate to recommend it. For people who may have more complex conditions, I use some of the most advanced technology available to find a minimally invasive and innovative solution to their problem. I am excited to bring my expertise to one of the top ranked orthopedic teams in the country, providing compassionate, minimally invasive care and advancing the field with the use of innovative technology. I am a member of The Hip Society, The Knee Society, and the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, at whose 2007 meeting I was awarded the Lawrence D. Dorr Surgical Techniques and Technologies Award.
