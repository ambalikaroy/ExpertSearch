 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me I have always been interested in fixing things. My uncle was an orthopedic surgeon and my aunt was a therapistI often visited their office and watched them work together. I saw them restore function and help people get back to their lives. Needless to say, it had a powerful influence on me. The same thing happened in medical schoolthe hand surgeons I met became my mentors. Seeing them help patients return to their daily activities inspired me to specialize in orthopedic surgery. Here at NYU LangoneOrthopedic Hospital , the specialists at the Hand Center treat all types of patients, from children with congenital hand deformities and young athletes with traumatic injuries to workers hurt during industrial accidents, older adults with arthritis, and people who have nerve injuries. Our team is comprised of surgeons, physician assistants, hand therapists, and other specialists. The multifaceted team, along with our advanced, onsite radiology and imaging services, including fluoroscopy, make for a fantastic patient experience. Because we are an academic medical center, we have the responsibility of teaching in addition to patient care. As a result, were kept on our toes and are always up-to-date on the latest treatment and research. The most important part of treatment, for me, is patient education. Its vital that my patients understand the nature of their conditions, so I take the time to draw illustrations and avoid clinical terminology. When people know how to take care of themselves, they can ensure that the treatment fits their life and work. Ive found that people are more empowered to help themselves get better when they understand the mechanics, history, and physiology of their injuries. I also research nerve injuries and wrist fractures to improve treatment nationwide. I am a member of the board of examiners for the American Osteopathic Board of Orthopedic Surgery and the former president of the hand section of the American Osteopathic Association. I have authored numerous papers and have been an invited speaker at national and international meetings.

Research My Research Interests wrist fractures, distal radius, flexor tendon repair, carpal tunnel syndrome, hand surgery Read less Research Summary My goal is to improve the lives of my patients by creating practical solutions to everyday problems. I believe that clinical research and the incredible resources available at the NYU Langone are crucial for achieving that goal. I have carried a passion for clinical research throughout my career, and I have been fortunate to collaborate with my colleagues at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital , some of the most outstanding trauma and hand surgeons and hand therapists. A few years ago, my colleagues and I started a database to track the treatment of patients with wrist fractures. From this database, we identified patterns that help us to determine the most effective treatments. Our insights led to significant changes in the way we treat wrist injuries here at NYU Langone and throughout the country. Another exciting area of research in which I have been involved is the treatment of nerve injuries, something millions of patients suffer from each year. Over the past two decades, research in this area has contributed to significant advances in nerve healing and the treatment of nerve injuries. I am gratified to contribute to such efforts here at NYU Langone.
