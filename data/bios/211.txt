 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I was drawn to the field of medicine since I was a child. Many of my fathers friends were doctors who would share stories about their experiences and teach me about medicine. Before my residency, I conducted research on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and treatments, particularly J-pouch surgery, which led me to specialize in colorectal surgery. I was inspired to help people who struggle with IBD, and as a surgeon, its gratifying to be able to relieve their symptoms by providing care.

As a colorectal surgeon at NYU Langones Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center , I primarily provide surgical treatments to people who have Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis. I perform J-pouch surgery for people with ulcerative colitis, and bowel resections and fistula surgeries for people with Crohns disease. I also treat other colorectal conditions such as cancer and diverticulitis. At our dedicated center, we have differentiated ourselves with our expertise and high volume of surgeries. We have also become a destination for patients who received treatment elsewhere and need revision surgery. We collaborate with gastroenterologists to provide complete care for our patients. We walk people through every step of their care and aim to educate them with all of the information necessary to make treatment decisions. At NYU Langone, we treat our patients as members of our family. I am a member of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons.
