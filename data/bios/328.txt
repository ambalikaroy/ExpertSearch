 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me People often ask why I became a gastroenterologist. Its because the gastrointestinal system plays a critical role in virtually every aspect of our health. It is essential not only to digestion and nutrition but also to immunity, metabolism, and the regulation of vital body systems. I am privileged to be a part of the gastroenterology profession, where I feel I can make a difference in both the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal disease. Video Player is loading.

In my clinical practice, I focus primarily on the prevention, detection, and diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancers and on performing state-of-the-art endoscopic procedureslike colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and endoscopic ultrasound. These procedures help us to diagnose cancer and identify potentially precancerous growths or changes in the colon, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, and other areas of the digestive system. In my research, I am interested in the bacteria of the gut, their effect on the development and prevention of disease, and the way in which advances in technology can be used to improve our ability to detect and treat precancerous and cancerous growths in the gastrointestinal system. My greatest passion is working with my patients to protect their health and improve their lives. Throughout the years, when Ive asked my patients what they think is important in a doctor, they have all consistently cited the same three things: a doctor who listens to them, cares about them, and provides them with hope. I strive to achieve this every day.
