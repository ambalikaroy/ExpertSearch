 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I have always been interested in the biological sciences. Prior to enrolling in medical school, I worked full-time in a research laboratory studying the molecular genetics of cancer. The desire to work with patients ultimately pushed me toward becoming a physician, and my passion for the field led me to remain in oncology. I find it highly rewarding to treat people who have cancer, and I provide individualized care to every patient. As a radiation oncologist at Perlmutter Cancer Center , I am involved in many aspects of cancer carecurative, adjuvant, and palliative. I treat patients with many different types of cancer and tumors, but my primary focus is treating gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary cancers. I have broad training in all forms of radiation therapy, including external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery. NYU Winthrop Hospital is one of the foremost centers in the world for SBRT. We strive to put our patients interests first and provide the highest level of care possible. As a team, we are always interested in improving efficacy and minimizing side effects for our patients. I have published multiple peer-reviewed publications, including novel research, review articles, and book chapters. Also, I have presented research at annual meetings for the European Society for Radiation Oncology and the American Society for Radiation Oncology.
