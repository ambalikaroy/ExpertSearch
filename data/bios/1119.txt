In addition, I perform ligament repair and reconstruction for torn ligaments, as well as meniscal transplants to replace the meniscus in a knee joint. I also perform shoulder surgeries to repair labral androtator cuff tears, including arthroscopic latarjet procedures for glenoid bone loss and arthroscopic acromioclavicular reconstruction. For patients with labral tears and femoroacetabular impingementa condition in which hip bones are irregularly shaped, causing joint damageI perform hip procedures. In my practice, the most important aspect of treatment is having an open dialogue with patients. The first thing I want people to tell me is how their injuries affect their lifestyles. After discussing this, I explain the diagnosis, how their condition developed, and the method through which each treatment option can help them. When discussing treatment alternatives, I am realistic about outcomes, and Im always frank about any risks involved. I also explain nonsurgical options, as many musculoskeletal conditions can be treated without surgery. I firmly believe knowledgeable and informed patients make the best decisions about their treatment. In addition to treating people with sports-related injuries at NYU Langone, I serve as an orthopedic consultant for the San Francisco Giants, USA Baseball, and the U.S. Womens National Volleyball team. I also perform sports medicine research to improve shoulder stabilization and develop meniscal scaffolds to reduce postoperative knee pain.
