 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me As a leader in the Division of Pediatric Nephrology at NYU Winthrop Hospital , I provide advanced care to children with urinary tractrelated conditions. I often treat children who have high blood pressure, urinary tract malformations, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and acute and chronic kidney diseases, including those that require all forms of dialysis. I have a special interest in taking care of children who struggle with bed-wetting and daytime urinary incontinence due to an overactive bladder. I have contributed extensively to the literature on voiding problems, vesicoureteral reflux, and urinary tract infections in infants and children. At NYU Winthrop Hospital we offer pediatric nephrology services that are not widely available, including a voiding dysfunction program and point-of-care ultrasonography of the kidneys and urinary tract. Treating chronic illness requires teamwork among the patient, family, medical personnel, and others involved in a patients care. As the captain of the team, I encourage and ensure good communication and chemistry between all the players. I believe that the best health outcomes are achieved through education on disease prevention, and when required, evidence-based treatment. I am committed to sharing knowledge about prevention and management of kidney and urinary tract problems through the Kidney and Urology Foundation of America (KUFA). I was a founding member of the KUFA Council of Pediatric Nephrology and Urology and have served as its educational chair for more than 20 years. This council is a unifying force for pediatric nephrologists in the New York metropolitan area and has organized annual educational symposia and several multicenter studies with broad participation from its members. In order to learn more about the cause of common calcium oxalate kidney stones, I help raise funds for the Oxalosis and Hyperoxaluria Foundation. This charity supports research on an uncommon but severe disease that predisposes people to kidney damage from calcium oxalate deposition in the kidney. To foster communication and share knowledge between primary care pediatricians and pediatric nephrologists, I have served on the executive committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)Section of Nephrology, the executive committee of the Nassau Pediatric Society, and the editorial board of the AAPs Pediatrics in Review nephrology program. The intellectual challenges of medicine, the excitement of new advances, and helping sick children become healthy again provide me with the rewards, zeal, and energy to be the best physician possible.
