 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me Ever since I was a child, I liked to help people and improve their lives however I could. As a surgeon, I care for patients with hernias, gall bladder problems, breast diseases, diverticulitis, colon diseases, and cancer. I perform advanced laparoscopic surgeries, adrenalectomies, and splenectomies, as well as breast surgery. I also perform robotic surgeries for hernia and complex abdominal wall surgeries. I perform surgery only as needed and strive to comfort patients even when surgery is not an appropriate option for them. Because of our vast surgery experience and great patient outcomes, our team at NYU Winthrop Hospital is proud and happy to exceed patient expectations. I have been recognized by Castle Connollys Top Doctor series and Im a member of the Nassau County Medical Society, the Nassau Surgical Society, the New York State Society of Surgeons, the American Society of Breast Surgeons, the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons, and the American Society of General Surgeons. Additionally, Im a fellow of the International College of Surgeons, the Nassau Academy of Medicine, and the American College of Surgeons.
