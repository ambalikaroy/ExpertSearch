 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me For as long as I can remember, I always wanted to become a doctor. As a child, I looked forward to visiting my pediatrician because I was so inspired by her. I was drawn to the field of medicine because I enjoy interacting with people and being a part of their care. Building relationships with my patients and their families, and working with them as we create personalized treatment plans to fight cancer, is of paramount importance to me.

Gynecologic oncology is the perfect fit for me because it combines multiple disciplines of medicine into one field, allowing me to use different approaches to treat people. I am both a surgeon and an oncologist, which gives me the opportunity to be involved in all aspects of my patients cancer care. As a gynecologic oncologist, I have the privilege of meeting and caring for the most courageous women who inspire and motivate me every day. At Perlmutter Cancer Center , I treat women who have endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer. Using an individually tailored combination of surgery and systemic therapies, including chemotherapy and targeted agents, I can successfully treat these different types of cancer. I am highly trained in a variety of advanced pelvic surgery techniques, including complex open surgeries and minimally invasive procedures. I use both the robotic approach and laparoscopy to perform minimally invasive surgery, which allows patients to recover faster and go home sooner. As part of an excellent team at NYU Langone, I am able to offer clinical trials to my patients, which gives them access to new and innovative treatments. I also treat women who have been diagnosed with a genetic mutation that increases their risk of gynecologic cancer. To help reduce this risk, I offer preventive treatments and risk-reducing surgery. I serve as the faculty mentoring champion for NYU Langones Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , directing junior faculty to mentors who can guide them in their career choices. I also enjoy training residents and fellows in my role as a professor at NYU School of Medicine. As a researcher, I have coauthored several peer-reviewed articles published in medical journals on the postoperative outcomes of cancer surgery. I have been awarded the Rosann and Richard Gutman Fund for Clinical Excellence and Career Enhancement, and I serve on the Society of Gynecologic Oncologys Palliative Care Task Force. In this role, I am entrusted with providing national guidelines and education for gynecologic oncologists to improve the lives of women who have cancer.
