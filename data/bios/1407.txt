 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me Im a pediatrician who specializes in preventing and treating allergies in children. I was drawn to this specialty because I wanted to understand why, more than ever, food allergies are so prevalent in children who live in developed countries. My fascination with this question led me to become one of the few pediatricians worldwide who is board certified in allergy and immunology. As director of the Pediatric Allergy Program at Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone , I work with children and their parents to treat allergies and to prevent new allergies from developing in the future. For example, infants who have eczema have a higher risk for developing food allergies later in life. One way to reduce this risk is by introducing children to common allergens, such as peanuts, eggs, and tree nuts, under medical supervision. This can help children develop tolerance to those foods. Children who have allergies also have an increased risk for asthma, atopic dermatitis, and a potentially lethal reaction called anaphylaxis, all of which can be managed and prevented with good pediatric allergy care. I develop long-term relationships with my patients that often start when they are babies and continue into young adulthood. Each stage of childhood has its challenges, from navigating childrens birthday parties to convincing a teenager, who wants nothing more than to fit in, to carry an epinephrine autoinjector. I believe strongly in involving children and their families in making decisions about their treatment. I take the time to explain all of their available options, answer their questions, and respect their preferences. The father of medicine, Hippocrates, lived by the tenet, cure sometimes, treat often, comfort always. I strive to practice these principles. I aim to bring competence, compassion, and cultural sensitivity to my work caring for children, as well as their families, who are impacted by the challenge of keeping their loved one safe from allergy triggers.
