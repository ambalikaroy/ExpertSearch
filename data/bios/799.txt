 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I chose to pursue a career in medicine because I enjoy working with people and wanted to use my skills and knowledge to impact their lives in a positive way. Headache medicine is an exciting field because there are more treatment options available than ever before. As a pediatric headache specialist, I treat children to help improve their quality of life. At Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone , I provide care to children who have headache disorders, including migraines, tension headaches, post-traumatic headaches, and cluster headaches, as well as facial pain syndromes. I also see patients at NYU Langones Concussion Center who have post-concussive headaches. I offer botulinum injections for chronic migraine prevention and nerve block and trigger point injections for various headache disorders. Also, I hope to start an inpatient infusion program for people who have migraines. When I meet with children and their families, I listen carefully to their symptoms and concerns and discuss all available treatment options with them. I want patients and their families to be familiar with all of their options, including alternative treatments. For each patient, I develop an individual care plan, because no one treatment fits all. I have a holistic approach to headache treatment that involves my patients, their family, their pediatrician, and their teachers at school. Also, due to my own cultural background, I enjoy working with families from many different backgrounds and perspectives. In addition to providing clinical care, I conduct research on treatments for migraines in children. Ive received a Frontiers in Headache Medicine Research Scholarship Award from the American Headache Society to study transcranial magnetic stimulation as preventive treatment for migraines in adolescents. My work on pediatric migraines has been published in US Neurology. I am a member of the American Headache Society and the International Headache Society.
