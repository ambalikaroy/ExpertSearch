 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me Driven by my fascination with biology, I knew from an early age that I wanted to pursue a scientific career. I acknowledge that science is not always exact, and there are often several paths available to achieve the best solution for a patients individual circumstances. But I enjoy being in the field of medicine because it allows me to help patients in meaningful ways. As a nephrologist, I treat all aspects of kidney disease, from high blood pressure and kidney stones to kidney failure. Though I do not perform kidney transplants, our highly specialized kidney transplant team is always available. We can connect our patients with the best surgeons. I believe that listening to patients individual voices is critical to providing effective care. I want patients and their loved ones to take control of their health through education and discussion. Patients should be involved as partners in the medical decision-making process. My priority is communicating with patients and their families to provide treatment options and explain the benefits and risks, as well as my professional opinion. I work with people to determine the best possible treatment plan.
