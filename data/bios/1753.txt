 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me Ive always been interested in peoples stories, and for many years, I wanted to be a writer. I find that practicing medicine and working as a radiation oncologist gives me the opportunity to not only care for people, but also to learn about their stories and understand whats important to them. I treat people who have cancers of the gastrointestinal system, including cancers of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, rectum, and anus. I pay a great deal of attention to each person I treat. Together, we design a personalized treatment plan, one tailored to their goals, priorities, preferences, and lifestyle. I also coordinate their care with our other cancer care providers, including surgeons and medical oncologists. At Perlmutter Cancer Center , we have special expertise in treating liver and pancreatic cancers with stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRTa highly precise form of radiation therapy. We have an expertise in chemoradiation treatments for patients who have gastrointestinal cancers and are not eligible for surgery. Our team has a reputation for excellent cancer outcomes, as well as managing long-term issues of quality of life after cancer treatment. Perlmutter Cancer Centers network of locations is continually expanding. With our many locations, were close to home for many people. We offer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, in addition to a wide range of supportive and integrative health services. My research focuses on improving patient outcomes and investigating ways to make radiation treatment safer and more effective for the people we treat. In addition to my clinical work, I am a member of NYU Langones Clinical and Translational Science Institute , which advances the translation of research findings into better cancer treatments. I am also dedicated to training the next generation of radiation oncologists as director of the radiation oncology residency program at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. I have been named in Castle Connollys Regional Top Doctors in 2019 and the Top Doctors series for the New York metro area in 2019 and 2020.
