 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me My interest in medicine emerged because I have a family member who has sickle cell anemia. Her condition predisposed her to develop hip arthritis at a young age, which had a negative impact on all aspects of her life. She eventually underwent a total hip replacement, and almost immediately, her pain, perceived appearance, and functionality improved. I was impressed with the significant change in her quality of life, and this sparked my interest in medicine and the specialty of orthopedics. Kolawole Jegede_v3 Video Player is loading.

As a spinal surgeon, I treat patients of all ages who fall anywhere on the spectrum of spine disease, ranging from cervical spine fractures, degenerative disc disease, and scoliosis to slipped discs. At NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn , our orthopedic team includes specialists who focus on hand, foot and ankle, spine, sports, and trauma-related injuries, as well as reconstructive joint replacement. We are a one-stop shop for patients; my colleagues and I collaborate to provide the best treatments. Orthopedic care is a team sport that relies on multiple playerssurgeons, physiatrists, physical therapists, and most importantly, our patients. Research is an integral part of my role as a physiciansurgeon. In my clinical research, I evaluate standing balance of the spine using our full body X-ray technology. I also investigate how small spinal fusions influence overall standing balance and look for factors to help patients avoid surgery. I am member of the North American Spine Society.
