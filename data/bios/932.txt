At NYU Langone, I treat people who have vascular malformations of the brain, brain aneurysms, and brain and skull base tumors. Our team includes neurologists, neuroradiologists, oncologists, and vascular surgeons, all of whom provide expert and compassionate care. When I treat a patient, I share my findings with my whole team so that together we can come up with recommendations that are in the persons best interests. I have a lot of respect for people who cope with serious health problems, and Im honored that they put their trust in me. My team and I work to provide them with the most effective treatments. We view them as family and do all we can to ensure that they receive the best care possible.
