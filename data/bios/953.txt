 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations About Me As a doctor, Im passionate about helping people live long, healthy lives. My interest in preventing and treating disease led me to pursue internal medicine, a specialty that combines medical science with compassionate, personalized care. As an internal medicine specialist, I found myself more and more frequently seeing patients whose health was negatively impacted by obesity. Extra pounds can increase a persons risk of several diseases, including prediabetes, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and osteoarthritis. I wanted to empower people to improve their overall health through weight loss, so I dedicated myself to weight management and became board-certified in obesity medicine in 2012. I was part of the first class of certifying physicians in this emerging field. Since 2018, I work exclusively with people who are interested in improving their health through weight management. I work at NYU Langones Weight Management Program , where we use medical weight loss programs that incorporate nutrition, lifestyle changes, and medications to help people achieve a healthy weight. We also help people identify the cause of their weight gain, which can include eating disorders, cravings, and unhealthy habits. By identifying barriers, I help people change their habits. Losing weight takes time and effort, and because peoples schedules dont always allow them to come to my office, I offer online doctor visits for follow-up appointments. These video visits take place through the NYU Langone Health app and let people meet with me in a time and place that is convenient for them. I take the time to listen to patients and educate them on how a healthy lifestyle can improve their overall health. By creating an individualized treatment plan, each patient has the practical solutions to make lifelong changes.
