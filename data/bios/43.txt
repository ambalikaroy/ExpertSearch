Dr. Palma isone of the international coordinatorsof the Natural History Study of the Synucleinopathies. He is the principal or co-investigator inclinical trials for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension andmultiple system atrophy as well as in the development of biomarkers of disease diagnosis and progression. His work in rare diseases is also focused on genetic autonomic disorders. Dr. Palma is interestedin definingthe phenotype and genotype of and clinical trial design and conductforfamilial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome) and other rare hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathies (HSAN).
