 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I pursued a career in medicine and the specialty of gastroenterology to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients. I chose to further specialize in conditions of the esophagus, in the field of neurogastroenterology and motility, because I developed a passion for using modern technology to prevent and treat the diseases that I see in my patients.

I examine the relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing or heartburn, and the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. Diet, stress, structural abnormalities, neurologic conditions, and many other factors can cause the gastrointestinal symptoms I see on a daily basis, and my overarching goal is to determine their specific cause to provide people with the best long-term care. I serve as the director of NYU Langones Center for Esophageal Health , where I see a wide spectrum of people who have gastrointestinal symptoms such as heartburn, throat discomfort, regurgitation, belching, and difficulty swallowing. I also treat patients who have been diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus or precancerous conditions, such as Barretts esophagus, and patients whose tests are normal for certain conditions but are still suffering from symptoms. As director, I work to ensure that all patients with esophageal conditions receive coordinated, comprehensive care from all of the specialists needed to diagnose and treat them. When I work with patients, I listen to and review each persons history in detail. Not every patient fits into a category, so I dont make assumptions when Im trying to understand a symptom. Sometimes, we pursue a specialized diagnostic test to determine what happens over a period of time while a patient engages in his or her normal daily routine. Other times, no prescription medications are necessary, and we find that simple dietary or lifestyle changes are helpful. I believe in an integrated and collaborative approach to patient care, enlisting the help of colleagues from other specialties, including advanced endoscopists, surgeons, allergists, swallowing therapists, and dietitians when needed. I also strongly believe in shared decision making. I ensure that patients understand their treatment options, as well as the evidence on the potential risks and benefits of each one. I participate on committees for the American College of Gastroenterology and the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society, and I am also an active member of the American Gastroenterological Association, American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and New York Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. I enjoy teaching and am heavily involved in NYU School of Medicines gastroenterology residency and fellowship training curricula.
