 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me Caring for people with severe obesity and performing bariatric surgery with skill and compassion are my main goals. I have performed more than 10,000 bariatric surgeries to treat people with severe obesity. I also have a special interest in treating adolescents who are obese. During my postgraduate training at the Royal Brisbane Hospital in Australia, I developed interests in laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, surgery and hepatobiliary pancreatic surgery. I then pursued training in bariatric surgery. I have been performing general surgery for 37 years and weight-loss surgery for 25 years, and I am also a professor of surgery at NYU School of Medicine. I was involved in the early days of the development of laparoscopic surgery, have taught laparoscopic techniques to surgeons around the world, and have published more than 150 journal articles, abstracts, and book chapters describing these techniques and their outcomes. In addition to weight loss surgery, I provide general laparoscopic surgery to treat gall bladder issues, hiatal hernias, and paraesophageal hernias. Im honored to be a fellow of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Surgeons of England, as well as an honorary fellow of the College of Surgeons, Glasgow. In 1999, after years of struggling with weight-related problems, I opted for a weight loss procedure called LAP-BAND surgery . I believe my experience gives me a uniquely personal perspective on my patients and allows me to best help them improve their quality of life.
