 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I work with women who have health issues that put them at risk for developing pregnancy complications, including maternal medical conditions and fetal congenital or genetic conditions. I value the close, personal relationships I form with these women and understand the great responsibility I have in caring for them and their future families. I consider the mothers and babys best interests with every treatment decision. One of my greatest accomplishments at NYU Langone has been collaborating with colleagues in other specialties to guide women through safe and healthy pregnancies. As the director of maternalfetal medicine at NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn , I am fortunate to work with excellent physicians in a variety of subspecialties, including anesthesia, cardiology, critical care, gastroenterology, neurology, and rheumatology. Together, my colleagues and I are able to treat women who have complex medical needs during pregnancy. For our patients who live in Brooklyn, we offer advanced care in the convenience of their borough, including prenatal ultrasound and diagnosis and outpatient consults for maternal and fetal complications. I am a National Institutes of Healthfunded clinical investigator for the National Environmental Children's Health Outcomes study, which seeks to better understand the effects of environmental exposures on fetal and childhood health outcomes. I also conduct collaborative research on how rheumatologic and inflammatory bowel diseases affect pregnancy.
