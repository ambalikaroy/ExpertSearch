 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me When I was a medical student, one of my instructors was a well-regarded sports medicine orthopedic surgeon and team physician. I admired him and was inspired to follow in his footsteps. At the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Mens Health and NYU Langone Madison Avenue Orthopedics , I treat patients with injuries affecting the knee, shoulder, elbow, hip, and anklewhether those injuries occurred on a sports field or walking down the subway stairs. Im becoming more involved in orthopedic interventional procedures for joint and tendon injuries, such as hyaluronic acid injections, platelet-rich plasma injections, and stem cell injections. These less-invasive procedures can often be done on an outpatient basis, so patients can recover more quickly and in the comfort of their own homes. I believe physical therapy is crucial in a persons recovery process. My patients often work with physical therapists and rehabilitation specialist at either the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Mens Heath or at our Sports Medicine Center . We provide a team approach to care and aim to meet all of our patients needs.
