 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me I began my healthcare career as a registered nurse. I wanted to build upon my nursing skills to further improve the lives of patients so I decided to pursue a career as a physician. I chose to specialize in infectious disease because I find it incredibly exciting to be involved in all of the major disciplines of medicine, and I have the opportunity to treat the whole person. I treat patients with a wide variety of infections, including endocarditis, fevers, HIV, and osteomyelitis. Most often, I see patients who are referred by other physicians for complex or unusual infections. I am proud to be recognized as a fellow of the American College of Physicians and to be included in Newsday s Top Doctors series.
