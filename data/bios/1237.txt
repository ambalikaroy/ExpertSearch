 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I was actively involved in sports from a young age, so I grew up around athletes and athletic injuries. Being a physicianand specifically a sports medicine expertallows me to help athletes return to the field and nonathletes to resume their activities and hobbies. I treat people with acute sports injuries as well as nonsports injuries, and I manage injuries that occur in most parts of the body. I choose treatments based on strong evidence of long-term outcomes, and Im conservative in my approach. In other words, I start with the least amount of intervention that gives the most positive results, and I move forward with additional treatment if necessary. Being a sports medicine specialist at NYU Langone is such a privilege. Ive consistently found that the people at NYU Langone embody friendliness, and teamwork prevails each day. My patients and I also work as a teamwe decide treatment plans together and establish a good rapport about their health. In addition to seeing patients at NYU Langone, I serve as the head team physician for the athletic programs at NYU and Long Island University, the chief medical officer for the New York City Public Schools Athletic League, and as a team physician for the U.S. Open tennis tournament. I am currently researching regenerative medicine and stem cell advancements for sports injuries and osteoarthritis. When Im not seeing patients or performing research, I cohost shows on SiriusXM Radio that focus on sports medicine and orthopedics.
