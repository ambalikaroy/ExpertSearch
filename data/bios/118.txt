 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me There were several important factors that impacted my interest in and pursuit of a career in medicine, specifically heart surgery. I was always drawn to the sciences, and physiology, particularly the structure and function of the heart, has always fascinated me. Early on I realized the rewards in helping others, both physically and emotionally. Medicine provides that opportunity dailythere is always a way to offer care and comfort. During medical school, the requirements to become a successful cardiothoracic and vascular surgeon became quite clear to mededication, a strong work ethic, perseverance, integrity, knowledge, and technical skill were all essential. I found this challenge exhilarating, and cardiothoracic and vascular surgery became, and remains, my passion. There is no greater reward in life than when a patient comes to me and says, Thank you for taking care of me! At NYU Winthrop Hospital , I see patients who require surgical evaluation for diseases of the heart, blood vessels, and lungs. I see patients who need coronary artery bypass, heart valve operations, and mitral valve repair, as well as those who have aneurysms and lung tumors. I offer minimally invasive procedures, including catheter-based valve replacement, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and robotic surgery. My goal is to make what is a stressful time for patients and their families as comfortable as possible. I provide the latest medical and surgical treatments with a comprehensive team of physicians and medical and administrative staff who all help provide patients with the most thorough evaluation and treatment. I always remember I am treating a person, not a disease, and that the newest treatment is not always the best treatment. Patient and family input is paramount when making decisions regarding medical plans and surgeryit is more than just science and technology. Medical care centers around patients with feelings, individual needs, and concerns. I am involved with the latest research and advancements in catheter-based treatments of heart valve disease, including TAVR and mitral valve repair. I am involved in basic science investigations with our research teams in NYU Winthrops new academic research center, studying tissue gene expression in different patient populations. I am a member of the American Heart Association and president emeritus of the Long Island chapter. I also belong to the American College of Surgeons, Society of Thoracic Surgery, New York Society of Thoracic Surgery, American College of Chest Physicians, and American College of Critical Care. Since 2009, I have been recognized by New York Magazine s Best Doctors in New York series.
