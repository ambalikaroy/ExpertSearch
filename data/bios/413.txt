 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I am a board-certified gynecologic oncologist who specializes in the surgical treatment of women with known or suspected ovarian and endometrial cancers. For most women who have these gynecologic cancers, surgery is an important part of the initial treatment and increases the possibility of long-term success. Every time I enter the operating room, my entire focus is directed toward completely removing the cancer.

A diagnosis of ovarian cancer can be very challenging for women and their families. Together, we create an individualized treatment plan that incorporates the latest knowledge in ovarian cancer therapy, both in the operating room and beyond. My team approach to ovarian cancer therapy, coupled with more than 20 years of experience, allows my patients to benefit from the most advanced surgical and medical treatments. In addition to my expertise in surgical management of advanced ovarian and endometrial cancers, I also have special training in minimally invasive surgerylaparoscopy and robotic surgeryand prevention surgery for women at high risk for gynecologic cancers. I incorporate chemotherapy that can be delivered directly into the abdomen for women who have advanced ovarian cancer. For women with recurrent ovarian cancer, I use genomic testing to analyze tumors and develop individualized therapies. This precision medicine approach can often create better treatment options for all women who have ovarian cancer. In my laboratory at NYU Langones Perlmutter Cancer Center , I focus on precision medicine, rare tumors, and early detection and prevention of gynecologic cancers. We are currently leading the development of national clinical trials for ovarian cancer prevention. We are also working to understand which women are most likely to respond to treatment with anticancer drugs so we can direct the best treatments toward the most appropriate patients. My research has been supported by the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Department of Defense, Stand Up to Cancer, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Alliance, the Foundation for Womens Cancer, and the V Foundation for Cancer Research. I have authored or coauthored more than 250 peer-reviewed research papers, articles, and book chapters. I am the founding editor of Atlas of Procedures in Gynecologic Oncology , and I serve on the scientific advisory committee of the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund and the Clearity Foundation. I am also a special advisor to the board of directors of The Honorable Tina Brozman Foundation and the co-chair of the ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, uterine carcinosarcoma, and Pan-GYN working groups for The Cancer Genome Atlas. I was honored to receive the Mentor Award from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Excellence in Ovarian Cancer Research Prize from the Foundation for Womens Cancer. I serve as the translational research co-chair of the uterine corpus cancer subcommittee for the NRG Oncology cooperative clinical trials group and as assistant dean of the Department of Defense Ovarian Cancer Academy.

The broad aims of my work are to develop novel biomarkers, expand the use of precision medicine, and understand rare tumors. Of particular interest are the early detection and prevention of ovarian cancer. We use next-generation sequencing to analyze circulating and shed biomarkers in order to develop better approaches for primary, secondary, and tertiary ovarian cancer prevention. Primary prevention often involves surgical procedures, but secondary and tertiary prevention can capitalize on newly discovered biomarkers. My colleagues and I are also engaged in translational research, where we apply precision medicine techniques in ongoing and completed clinical trials. We study tumor specimens and companion normal tissues to determine the molecular featuresincluding DNA mutations, epigenetics, transcriptomics, and proteomics associated with specific patient responses. We also apply these techniques to model systems in order to identify subgroups of patients who are uniquely sensitive or resistant to targeted therapies, such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors or immune checkpoint blockade. In recent years, my laboratory has discovered driver mutations, which confer a selective growth advantage and thus promote cancer development, for certain rare tumor types. We recently discovered universal SMARCA4 gene mutations that appear to be a critical driver for a very aggressive form of cancer that affects young womensmall-cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type. The SMARCA4 encodes a catalytic ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. We subsequently determined that expression of the SMARCA2 protein, another catalytic subunit of this complex, is also lost in all of these tumors. In most other solid tumors with a SWI/SNF loss, a compensatory upregulation of other members of this protein complex counteracts the functional loss of any single component. We continue to investigate the remarkable concurrent loss of both catalytic ATPase SWI/SNF subunits to better understand this disease pathogenesis. We are elucidating the mechanisms that permit these tumors to develop and spread. We are advancing the fight against these rare tumors by developing biological models to help with drug development and to share with scientists worldwide. As division director of gynecologic oncology, I have also overseen the development of our clinical trial portfolio and the translational research program.
