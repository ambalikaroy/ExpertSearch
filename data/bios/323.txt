Research My Research Research Summary My specific research interests include diseases of the bile ducts and pancreas, interventional endoscopy, and the diagnosis and management of small intestine diseases, using both noninvasive imaging technologies and direct endoscopic evaluation. I work closely with my colleagues in this capacity as an attending physician in interventional endoscopy within the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and the Center for Advanced Therapeutics and Innovation. I also enjoy managing both standard and complex general gastroenterological and endoscopic issues in a wide variety of patients in the ambulatory, hospital, and intensive care settings. In the context of these interests, I have served on the faculty at local and national meetings and in hands-on procedural training courses, and have delivered lectures regionally and nationally in my areas of focus. I publish actively in these areas, as well as on topics within general gastroenterology. I am actively involved in medical education and very much enjoy teaching medical students; I have lectured in and recently codirected the gastroenterology section of the introductory medical school course on clinical medicine. I also teach medical residents and am particularly focused on the teaching and procedural training of fellows in the divisions gastroenterology and advanced interventional endoscopy fellowship programs. For the latter, I served as the founding program director. I have also served as codirector of the NYU Langone Seminars in Gastroenterology course, which has featured local and national faculty and serves to provide medical practice updates to physicians in academic and community practice. Recently, I have become more involved in studying and improving the delivery of high-quality healthcare. In my role as director of gastrointestinal quality and strategic initiatives for the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Mens Health and the Joan H. Tisch Center for Womens Health , I work with colleagues to coordinate initiatives to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare. My colleagues and I also strive to streamline multidisciplinary approaches to care that involve our gastroenterology services, including how they can interface with other specialties to optimize patient safety and wellbeing, as well as the efficiency and overall experience of patient care. My clinical, academic, and educational experiences continue to drive my passion for medicine. This is a particularly exciting and energizing time to be involved in the many efforts and accomplishments at NYU Langone.
