 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I was drawn to medicine and medical oncology for their potential to help people. I wanted to provide care to people who have serious illnesses and guide them and their families through difficult and emotional times. As a medical oncologist, I find it rewarding to provide patients with emotional support in addition to medical treatment. I see patients who have a broad spectrum of hematologic and oncologic conditions, including breast cancer, lung cancer, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and benign hematologic conditions, such as iron deficiency anemia. At Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Ambulatory Care Rego Park, I perform bone marrow aspirations and biopsies and oversee patients treatments and infusions. I manage a variety of conditions, so the treatments I offer patients vary, from iron infusions, chemotherapy for tumors, and novel biologic agents to immunotherapy. I also treat patients at NYU Langone Medical AssociatesGreenpoint . In addition to providing people with my medical expertise, I aim to create a warm and comfortable environment; my goal is to educate patients about their conditions, prognoses, and treatments, so they are well-informed. Patients leave with visit summaries, and I hope, answers to all of their questions. My approach to treatment is guided by the Latin saying primum non nocere , which means first, do no harm. I weigh every treatment decision carefully and tailor them to the unique social and medical needs of each individual. I am a member of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
