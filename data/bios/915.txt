 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I always had a great interest in science, and when I took my first psychology class in high school, I realized I loved the way the mind worked. During medical school, I loved building relationships and speaking with my patients. I chose neurology because I find the brain fascinating, but it is also one of the most complex and misunderstood areas of medicine. The specialty also allows me to incorporate a lot of the knowledge that I learned from internal medicine and psychiatry. As a third-year medical student, I witnessed a patient recover from a stroke and regain the ability to speak. I knew then that I wanted to be part of a field that was growing constantly and striving to reverse devastating neurological diseases. I see patients with all types of neurological conditions in the hospital, such as multiple sclerosis, seizures, Parkinsons disease, headaches, and dizziness. I specialize in treating patients who have ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and often perform procedures to remove blood clots. At NYU Winthrop Hospital , we use a team approach for treating every patientwe work closely with other physicians, advanced care providers, nurses, case managers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speechlanguage pathologists, and social workers to provide interdisciplinary care that is individualized. I also strive to make sure that my patients are educated in their illness and treatment options in a way that they can understand. I encourage them to see the greater good of their situation and use their treatment plan as a chance to make lifestyle changes and take better care of themselves. I am an active member of the American Academy of Neurology. Additionally, I am the director of stroke at NYU Winthrop Hospital, which has been a very rewarding experience.
