I use a combination of traditional approaches and advanced, minimally invasive techniques to improve safety, speed of recovery, and outcomes for my patients. I maintain wonderful relationships with my patients and find it incredibly rewarding to help them by managing their conditions and performing surgeries. It is vital for physicians to completely understand how a condition affects a patient. To do so, we must be familiar with the persons overall health, sense of wellbeing, and quality of life, as well as the impact of the condition on the persons relationships and families. Having this information helps me to create individualized treatment plans. Treatments cannot be one size fits all, because every patient experience is unique. Our team, regarded as one of the best in the world, pays close attention to each persons needs and diagnosis. In addition to treating patients, I conduct research on incontinence, the effects of multiple sclerosis and neurologic disorders on the bladder, and treatment of people with overactive bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia, or an enlarged prostate. Im very fortunate to have received a grant from the Allergan Foundation to continue my research on incontinence. This funding also enables me to train future leaders in the field. I am proud to have been selected by Super Doctors for a Rising Star distinction in the New York Metro area and by The Leading Physicians of the World for a Top Urologist award.
