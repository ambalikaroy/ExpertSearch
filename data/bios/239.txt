Research My Research Interests immunology, neuropathology, neuroscience, Alzheimer's disease, prion diseases, immunomodulation Read less Research Summary I am a board-certified neurologist and neuropathologist, and I run an active research laboratory focusing on neurodegenerative disorderswith a particular focus on the mechanisms that drive amyloid deposition in Alzheimers and prion diseases. This work has led to over 300 peer-reviewed publications, 28 issued patents, and continuous funding from the NIH for over30 years. My lab has made key discoveries in gaining a greater understanding of possible therapeutic interventions, including discovering the role of apolipoprotein E (APOE) in driving amyloid deposition in late-onset Alzheimers disease. I coined the term pathological chaperone to denote the role of APOE, even before the discovery of the link between the APOE E4 allele and late-onset Alzheimers disease. More recently,my laboratory developed a novel therapeutic approach based on blocking the interactions between apoE and amyloid , showing it to be effective in multiple Alzheimer's diseasemodels. My lab also develops strategies for the enhanced clearance of pathological conformations of both amyloid beta and tau proteins in Alzheimers disease, using both active and passive immunization approachesspecifically through targeting toxic oligomeric species as well as through the stimulation of innate immunity via agonists of Toll-like receptor 9. These approaches have been highly efficacious in several rodent and non-human primate models of Alzheimers and prion diseases. We tested these immunomodulation approaches for a broader list of neurodegenerative diseases, called conformational diseases. Our approaches delay the onset of disease in animal models of prion infection. Recent studies have focused on testing a novel mucosal vaccine in white-tailed deer to prevent chronic wasting disease, an emerging, highly infectious prion disease affecting large numbers of cervids in the United States, Canada, and recently in northern Europe. Our data suggest that mucosal vaccination can confer partial protection from the prion agent, representing the first partially effective treatment for naturally occurring prion disease. Recently my laboratory has developed an unbiased localized proteomic methodology that produces robust data utilizing archival formalin, fixed paraffin embedded human tissue, and used this method to perform the most extensive proteomic analyses of amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease patient tissue. I obtained my MD at Kings College London GKT School of Medical Education. I completed my residencies and chief residencies in neurology and neuropathology at NYU School of Medicine and New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, respectively.
