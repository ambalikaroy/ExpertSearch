 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me Im an orthopedic surgeon at the Sports Medicine Center at NYU Langone Orthopedic Center and assistant professor in NYU Langones Department of Orthopedic Surgery. I specialize in sports-related injuries as well as arthroscopic and reconstructive surgery of the knee, shoulder, and ankle. I also perform cartilage restoration surgery and administer platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and stem cell injections. Both of my parents are physicians, and my father is an orthopedic surgeon himself, so I was exposed to the specialty at a young age. I was always fascinated with the form and function of the human body. I chose to pursue a career in orthopedics because I love being able to fix a problem and restore a patients quality of life. I see patients who injure themselves playing professional or recreational sports or merely performing everyday tasks. My main objective is to put people at ease when they are considering surgical treatment. I provide them with a complete picture of what to expect before, during, and after surgery to help them feel more comfortable and secure about their decision. I take pride in my conservative approach to treating patients. Whenever possible, we begin with nonsurgical treatments, and proceed to surgery if necessary. My goal is to restore a patients function and help them return to the activities they enjoywhether its throwing a football again or being able to pick up a child. My clinical research focuses on shoulder and knee injuries, cartilage restoration, and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries.
