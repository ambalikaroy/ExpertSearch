 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I couldnt refuse the tremendous opportunity to come to NYU Langone in 2013. To be the chair of the Hansjrg Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery in an institution with such a remarkably rich surgical history allows me to follow in the footsteps of giants in the field. The energy of NYU Langone, in the heart of New York City, empowers all of us working in this department to treat any patient in need of reconstructive plastic surgery successfully.

I treat patients whove had traumatic injuries resulting from boating or motor vehicle accidents as well as those with disfigurement due to cancer treatment, congenital birth defects such as cleft lip, and skeletal, jaw, or skull abnormalities. I also specialize in microsurgery. Using this procedure, for example, I can transfer muscle from one part of a patients body to anotherto the face to enhance a smile, or to a limb to restore function. The most gratifying part of plastic surgery is that I treat patients from head to toe. Many of the most important advances in reconstructive and cosmetic surgery were developed here at NYU Langone. Ive been involved in a significant amount of research that has led to great improvements in facial transplantation, and I serve as director of our Face Transplant Program . Our work has made this procedure safer and more feasible for wounded veterans, civilians, and first responders. Since 2005, when the first face transplant was performed in France, weve been studying the long-term effects of facial transplantation surgery, such as how patients tolerate medications afterward and how to reduce the number of medications they must take to prevent organ rejection.
