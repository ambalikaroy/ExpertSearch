 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me The desire to care for people followed me throughout my primary education and college. During the first year of my pediatrics residency, I was introduced to the field of pediatric cardiology. Pediatric cardiology is one of the few fields of medicine that allows me to follow a patient from fetal life all the way through adulthood. Im able to forge bonds with my patients and their families. Cardiology also encompasses the aspects of medicine that I am most passionate about, including fetal, neonatal, and cardiac physiology, critical care medicine, outpatient cardiac care, and most importantly, the privilege of meeting and interacting with amazing infants, children, adolescents, and their families. I care for young patients with a wide variety of cardiac issues, including congenital structural heart defects, such as patent ductus arteriosus, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, single ventricle disorders, and aortic stenosis. I also care for patients who may have heart muscle disorders, as well as acquired cardiac diseases, such as rheumatic heart disease and myocarditis. Our practice also sees patients who may also have heart rhythm disorders. Often our patients come to us complaining of chest pain, fainting, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, and heart murmur. My office performs fetal echocardiography to diagnose heart disease prenatally, pediatric echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, Holter and event monitoring, cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing, cardiac MRI, and cardiogenetics testing. We have a robust and compassionate team of doctors, nurses, an exercise physiologist, medical assistants, and sonographers who provide individualized care to each patient and their families. We strongly believe that in order for a patient to be well-cared for, we should treat them as if they were our own family members. We work closely with pediatric cardiothoracic interventionalists, pediatric cardiothoracic surgeons, and our maternalfetal medicine team to coordinate the effective and efficient care for patients, their families, and in the case of expectant mothers, their unborn children with cardiac disorders. Patients of our practice become a part of our family. I strive to treat all patients and their families with dignity, respect, and compassion, and provide the highest degree of care in accordance with up-to-date practice guidelines. I am a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Society of Echocardiography.
