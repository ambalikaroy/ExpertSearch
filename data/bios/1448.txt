 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me I chose to become a physician because I wanted to have an impact and to care for others in an intellectually challenging and satisfying setting. At NYU Langone, I serve as the director of the Division of Pediatric Endocrinology. I treat children and adolescents who have growth disorders, disorders of puberty, polycystic ovarian syndrome, metabolic disorders, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal gland disorders. I approach diagnosis by casting a wide net and not taking anything for granted. Even if I think that I know what a child is experiencing, I complete the evaluation and carefully examine every detail to make the most accurate diagnosis possible. I am honored that my diagnoses and treatments have had a profoundly positive impact on childrens lives. I work with an outstanding team of seasoned and dedicated doctors, nurses, nutritionists, and social workers at the Fink Childrens Ambulatory Care Center , part of Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone . Together, we provide services for children as well as their families. Our patient care is supported by the clinical and basic science research we conduct at NYU Langone. My research focuses on the adrenal gland, growth disorders, and pituitary disorders. I have been involved with various committees of the Pediatric Endocrine Society and the Endocrine Society.
