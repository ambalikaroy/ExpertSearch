 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I have always had a strong interest in medicine, but the heart is the part of the body I find most fascinating. Its dynamic nature, in combination with my drive to take care of others, led me to specialize in both cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology. mat-williams-bio-april-2016 mat-williams-bio-april-2016 Video Player is loading.

These two specialties treat the same diseases using different sets of tools. Having trained in both, I can approach my patients conditions from two angles to find the best treatment. My team and I treat people who have different types of heart valve diseases. Most commonly, we see people with aortic valve stenosis, or the narrowing of the main valve of the heart, and mitral valve regurgitation, in which the mitral valve does not close effectively, causing blood to flow backward. Our treatments range from surgery, including minimally invasive procedures, to less invasive transcatheter approaches that avoid the need for open heart surgery. We specialize in using advanced transcatheter technology, and I have performed close to 4,000 of these types of procedures. My team at the Heart Valve Center has also performed the most mitral valve clip procedures in the region. As director of the Heart Valve Center, I am fortunate to lead a team of physicians specialized in multiple aspects of heart valve conditions. This diversity allows us to view each condition from various angles and collaborate to create the safest, most effective treatment for our patients. I also focus on individualizing treatmentsone person may benefit from surgery, whereas another may recover better from a less invasive procedure. Heart valve disease can be a frightening diagnosis, and I do what I can to put my patients at ease. We have an incredibly compassionate team here at NYU Langone, and we collaborate with social workers, dietitians, physical therapists, and other professionals to make the treatment and recovery process as seamless as possible.
