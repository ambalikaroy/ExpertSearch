 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me A career in medicine was the perfect choice because it allowed me to use my love for science in a meaningful and practical way. I was drawn to radiation oncology because it combines personal patient interaction with the use of complex technology to help people during challenging times in their lives. While I was training for my doctorate degree, I worked in a breast cancer laboratory, which inspired me to specialize in this area.

As a radiation oncologist at NYU Langones Perlmutter Cancer Center , I use radiation therapy to treat people with all types of breast cancer. I work as part of a larger team that includes medical oncologists and surgeons. Our team has pioneered the use of new technology and contributed to research findings that have led to the development of new radiation therapy techniques that allow us to minimize the side effects of radiation. With these advances in the field, we can treat people who have cancer in its early stages and also its advanced stages, including when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. I am fluent in English and Spanish, and I enjoy interacting with the diverse patient population in New York City. When patients come to me for care, I do my best to help them understand their diagnosis and treatment options. Its rewarding to get to know my patients and be able to support them throughout their treatment. Im active in clinical trials for a new treatment called partial breast irradiation, which allows radiation to be completed in one week and targets a smaller area of the breast. This approach can be very effective for people with cancer that is in the early stages. I am also involved in research on personalizing breast cancer treatment by understanding each patients genetic makeup.
