 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I am a board certified gynecologic oncologist with more than 15 years of experience diagnosing, treating, and caring for women who have gynecologic cancer. I provide state-of-the-art care and access to the most cutting-edge treatment options, as I am most passionate about ensuring the best possible outcomes. I review each womans diagnosis in depth and work with her to help her understand her options and create a personalized treatment plan. We discuss the immediate and future impact of the cancer diagnosis on her life, including treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. I also provide screening and prevention measures and access to advanced clinical trials. I am an expert surgeon skilled in minimally invasive laparoscopic and robotic assisted surgery as well as extensive radical debulking procedures, in which malignant tumors are removed to make additional therapies more effective. The additional therapies I provide with the help of my exceptional team at NYU Langone include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. My team includes gynecologic oncologists, pathologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, genetic counselors, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, and radiologists. I understand that a cancer diagnosis can lead to fear and confusion. My aim is to ease these concerns and pay close attention to each womans unique medical, social, and psychosocial needs. I tailor treatment to optimize care and eliminate cancer, while maintaining quality of life. As a professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at NYU School of Medicine, I am actively involved in training medical students, residents, and fellows. I am also the director of gynecologic oncology clincal trials; my research is currently focused on clinical trials involving new treatments for ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. I have been honored with a variety of awards and recognized for teaching and research, and I am a member of several professional societies, including the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, NRG Oncology, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
