VIDEO:Meet the Abrams family, who credit the health of their daughter, born months early, to the excellent care of Dr. Pradeep Mally and his team of NICU experts at Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone. As a neonatologist at Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone , I work in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with newborns who are born prematurely or those who are full-term but are born with serious birth defects involving major organs, including the heart, brain, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. I chose to subspecialize in neonatology because of my interest in caring for critically ill infants and the potential difference that I could make in their lives. Our NICU at Tisch Hospital is recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics as a level IV NICU, which means that we can provide care for the highest level of critical illness and can treat all babies who have any kind of critical condition. We have immediate access to any subspecialist or technology that a newborn may require. We also practice family-centered care. Parents can be in the NICU 24/7, and as soon as their babies are healthy enough, we encourage skin to skin contact, or kangaroo care. We also make sure that our care aligns with the babies' natural development. If a baby is born prematurely, we try to recreate the environment of the mothers womb by making sure the NICU has very low levels of light and sound. My research interests include studying premature newborns who have breathing and lung diseases, the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to manage anemia in premature newborns, and the acute and long-term outcomes in late pre-term infants. Additionally, I am a board member of the American Academy of Pediatrics and a member of the Society of Pediatric Research.
