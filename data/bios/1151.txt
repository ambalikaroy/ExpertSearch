 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me It was during my orthopedic surgery training that I discovered a passion for hand and upper limb surgery. These orthopedic surgeries require a high level of technical expertise and experience in managing challenging conditions, such as nerve and vessel injuries, arthritis, birth deformities, tumors, tendon injuries, and fractures. My patients may be infants with congenital malformations, older adults with incapacitating osteoarthritis, professional athletes with sports injuries, classical musicians with overuse syndromes, or workers injured in occupational accidents. Joining the faculty of NYU Langone enabled me to use the considerable resources at a major university-based medical center to provide the best care possible to all of my patients. NYU Langones Hand Center is a uniquely integrated facility where a core group of hand and upper extremity surgery experts and ancillary specialists collaborate to deliver state-of-the-art care. We work closely with plastic surgeons, neurologists, rehabilitation specialists, and occupational and physical therapists. At the Hand Center, we get to know our patients, so we can personalize our approach and tailor treatment to each individual. I try to impart to residents and fellows the importance of making a connection with patients. Listening to my patients helps me to better understand their needs and expectations. I am deeply committed to research and education, and I perform hundreds of surgeries a year. My priority, though, is to individualize care for each person who comes to me for treatment. Improving a persons quality of life by restoring the use of his or her limbs after trauma or reconstructing a deformed or dysfunctional hand can be very gratifying. The concerted effort and dedication of the entire Hand Center team makes it a pleasure to come to work everyday.
