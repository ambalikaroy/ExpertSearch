Obstetrics and gynecology, and especially my focus on infertility, bring together the science and personal interactions with patients, whichI love. I am incredibly invested in helping couples discover why theyve been unable to conceive. At NYU Langone, we offer some of the most exciting fertility breakthroughs of our time, including the latest fertility drugs and genetic testing, to support couples in creating the families they want. Before I practiced as an OB/GYN, I trained in psychiatry, which prepared me to help couples cope with the emotions that accompany reproductive choices. I empower my patients to be involved in the entire process, and I help them to weigh their options based on their unique values and goals. Breakthroughs in contraceptive technology have given women the ability to delay having children, but by a womans late 30s and early 40s, the ability to conceive declines. Our research lab focuses on the causes of age-related infertility, primarily the aging of the eggs themselves. Were working on new treatments to slow this process. Weve also made incredible advances in in vitro fertilization, including our ability to decrease the likelihood of miscarriage by using genetic testing of the embryo to determine its integrity before transfer.

During this time the chance of pregnancy decreases and the chance of miscarriage increases, related to chromosome and other abnormalities in the eggs. My research group studies why a woman's eggs lose viability. We discovered changes in the chromosomes' ends, called the telomeres. We found that telomere attrition may contribute to the decreased fertility, as well as the increased miscarriage and aneuploidy risks observed in older women. We are developing tests of egg health based on measurement of telomere length. We also have shown in experimental animals that preventing telomere attrition may delay reproductive aging.Finally, we are using genomic approaches to identify the genes that influencetelomere length and reproductive longevity in women.
