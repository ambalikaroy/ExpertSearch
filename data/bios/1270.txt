 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me The ease with which we take our voices for granted becomes apparent when a person develops vocal cord problems. Thats why I specialize in treating such problems as the director of NYU Langones Voice Center , which brings together physicians, speech pathologists, and others to improve the lives of people with voice, swallowing, and upper airway disorders.
