 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me Severe and complex trauma of an upper extremity, such as the hand, brings about drastic life changes. As a hand surgeon and microsurgeon, my passion is treating people with severe injuries through reconstruction. I was drawn to this specialty during my residency, when I trained at one of the foremost trauma hospitals in the world. Since my hand and microsurgery fellowship, I have completed extensive additional training with premier surgeons at hospitals in Asia. At NYU Langone, I treat adults and children of all ages who have complex nerve, vascular, and bony and soft tissue injuries of the upper extremities. This includes amputations, non-unions, severe wounds, and brachial plexus injuries. In addition, I treat children who have complex congenital hand conditions. Many of my patients come to me after consulting multiple surgeons, seeking solutions for their challenging problems. I strive to provide solutions where others are not able, helping people regain meaningful function. Through working collaboratively with my colleagues in both orthopedic and plastic surgery, Im able to meet the unique needs of my patients and offer treatments such as limb reconstruction. For complex problems, it is necessary to draw from the strengths and knowledge of all fields and to work at the interface of both orthopedic and plastic surgery. Only through this team approach can we best evaluate patients needs and provide the treatments that are ideal for them. As the assistant research director for NYU Langones Division of Hand Surgery, I am very active in basic science, translational science, and clinical research. My primary research interests are the functional reconstruction of limbs for people who have sustained traumatic injuries involving muscle, bone, skin, blood vessels, and nerves. In 2017, I was awarded a traveling fellowship from the American Society for Surgery of the Hand and have travelled extensively through China and India in order to be at the forefront of the field.
