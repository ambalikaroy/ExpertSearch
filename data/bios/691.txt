 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I went into pediatrics because I believe that healthy children make healthy adults, and eventually, a healthy society. Pediatrics as a field has the potential to help our future generation become more informed and healthier. I chose to further specialize in neonatal medicine to give hope to children facing challengespreterm infants who require the utmost care in the beginning of their lives. I specialize in caring for babies with multiple medical conditions, including premature birth, neonatal respiratory distress, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, neonatal infections, sepsis, and more. I perform many procedures, including intubation, placement of central vascular catheters, chest tubes, hypothermia therapy for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, high frequency ventilation, and inhaled nitric oxide therapy. I also perform swallowing assessments using fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, an endoscopy designed to diagnose feeding disorders in neonates. Our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at NYU Winthrop Hospital has excellent outcomes in the survival of preterm babies; theyre some of the best in the country. Our team encompasses a diverse group of neonatologists, practitioners, nurses, respiratory therapists, and other support staff who work together to provide the best care. Our neonatologists are available around the clock, ready to respond to any emergencies. My primary clinical research focuses on strategies aimed at diagnosis and management of neonatal feeding disorders. I also study inflammatory and immunological conditions affecting pregnancy using laboratory-based placenta models. In addition, I lead quality improvement and patient safety activities aimed at reducing blood stream infections in neonates in the NICU. I am a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and a member of the American Society for Reproductive Immunology and the Eastern Society for Pediatric Research.
