 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me I dont come from a family of doctors, but from a very young age I wanted to pursue a career in medicineIve always been drawn to helping people. Before medical school, I was a teacher in Tokyo and coached childrens sports teams, which sparked my initial interest in pediatrics. It wasnt until medical school that I discovered the field of pediatric orthopedic surgery. I fell in love with the hands-on aspect of the specialty and how it allows me to provide children with concrete solutions to lead healthy and active lives.

As a pediatric orthopedic sports surgeon at NYU Langones Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital , I frequently work with children who have bone injuries like fractures. Often my patients are young athletes whose injuries are sports-related, including patellar instability, which is a dislocation of the kneecap; meniscal tears such as torn discoid menisci; and ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) that require surgical reconstruction. The injuries that children and adolescents get are unique to growing bodies, so the treatments I offer are tailored to their needs. I have specialized training in physeal-sparing surgical techniques that allow me to avoid injury to young athletes growth plates so that there is no disruption to their normal growth. Because I was also a competitive athlete growing up and during college, I can relate to my patients on a personal level. Often, my patients and their families tell me its useful that I speak the lingo. As a doctor, my goal is to understand each patients individual needs and challenges so that I can provide high-quality, personalized care. From my own experience, I understand how injuries and surgeries can affect young athletes not just physically, but socially and emotionally as well. I think my patients appreciate this. I am a cheerleader for my patients throughout treatment and recovery. I set and manage reasonable expectations, but I also believe in the power of positive thinkingI like to harness this power to ensure that my patients meet their goals for participating in sports and other physical activities. In addition to my clinical role, Im excited to be the director of the Center for Womens Sports Health at NYU Langones Joan H. and Preston Robert Tisch Center at Essex Crossing . I also stay busy as the chair of the Womens Health Issues Advisory Board for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, and I am a member of the board of directors of the Pediatric Research in Sports Medicine Society. On weekends, I enjoy working as a team physician for the National Womens Hockey League. In my research, I examine how a persons sex and gender affect health outcomes in musculoskeletal medicine. Im also interested in understanding barriers, such as socioeconomic ones, that prevent people from participating in sportsI believe that athletics should be accessible to everyone. Ultimately, I hope to encourage children and adolescents to participate in sports in a fun and safe manner so that they continue to reap the benefits of being physically active throughout their lives.
