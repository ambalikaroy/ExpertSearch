 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I began my own journey of weight loss as a preteen when I modified my lifestyle, improving my diet and becoming more active in sports. I continued to pursue my interest in weight management during college at Boston University, where I trained as a group fitness instructor. Even during my regimented medical school years, I helped patients and fellow classmates lead more active lives and use nutrition to improve their overall health. Video Player is loading.

During my fellowship in nutrition and obesity medicine, I honed my skills in evidence-based medicine to treat people who were overweight, and I used nutrition as a way of caring for the whole patient. I scored in the top 10 amongst physicians who passed the board examination for the American Board of Obesity Medicine. In recent years, I have served on the bariatric medicine committee for the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, as well as on the advisory board and board of directors for the Obesity Action Coalition. I also train other physicians in weight management and nutrition. I take great pleasure in educating the general public through lectures, workshops, and radio segments on the importance of maintaining a normal weight. In 2012, I joined the Weight Management Program . In my practice, I combine scientifically proven weight loss techniques with medications and behavior modification to fit each patients needs. I designed the New You program to help people obtain results while learning about incorporating nutrition into a healthy lifestyle. I understand that making the time to focus on your own health can be challenging. Thats why I offer online doctor visits for follow-up appointments. During these video visits through the NYU Langone Health app , I talk with you about progress on adopting new eating habits and incorporating physical fitness into your schedules. This online doctor visit saves the time of traveling to an appointment, without sacrificing any of the benefits of routine follow-up care. I am involved in research examining the effects of liraglutide, a naturally occurring intestinal hormone, on people who have regained weight after bariatric surgery and the outcomes of medications being developed for obesity management. I also educate students at NYU School of Medicine in diagnostic and treatment techniques for people with obesity.
