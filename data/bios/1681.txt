As a researcher, I work to increase our understanding of why some people develop arterial blockages and clots that lead to heart attack and stroke, and others do not. Im specifically interested in the role platelets, as well as other blood-clotting proteins, play in heart disease, stroke, and vascular disease in the legs, especially for people who dont have typical risk factors such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure. In my work as director of NYU Langones Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease , I often receive referrals from doctors who are uncertain of the cause of a patients heart disease or stroke. Because they do not have typical risk factors for heart disease, their condition presents a bit of a medical mystery. I want to understand everything about these patients, from the scientific information in their lab report to their nutrition, exercise habits, lifestyle, and medical and family history. These conversations, in addition to state-of-the-art risk factor testing performed at our center, are critical to helping identify the cause of their condition and preventing illness. The future of heart disease prevention is very bright. At the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, we specialize in caring for people at risk for heart disease, including groups of people traditionally overlooked to be at increased risk for heart disease. These include women who had high blood pressure or high blood sugar when pregnant, women with early menopause, people who have rheumatological conditions, and people who previously received cancer treatment. We also work with people who have a strong family history of heart disease, stroke, or blood clot, and those who have related risk factors such as hypertension and elevated blood sugar. There is great opportunity to help people prevent heart disease, and my goal is to equip patients with the information and treatments needed to take control of their health.

Research My Research Interests cardiovascular biology Read less Research Summary Dr Berger's research primarily focuses on discovering novel mechanisms of heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. He is also interested in 1) the etiology of unexplained thromboembolic (clotting) disease; 2) the clinical and cellular response to antithrombotic agents in cardiovascular disease; and 3) sex differences in the pathophysiology and treatment response of cardiovascular disease. Dr. Berger has a particular interest in the field of platelet and hypercoagulable mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, with research interests that include: (1) the role of platelet activity in patients with different high risk vascular phenotypes, such as cardiac and peripheral atherosclerosis, aneurysmal disease, venous disease, kidney disease, and HIV; (2) regulation of platelet activity during the perioperative period; (3) the clinical and platelet response to antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapeutics; and (4) the study of personalized medicine using the platelet phenotype to guide therapeutics. Dr. Berger has set up a platelet lab to measure platelet activity using various techniques, including whole blood and platelet rich plasma aggregometry, flow cytometry, hematology analysis, and molecular biology using the platelet transcriptome. The overall goal of the lab is to use the platelet phenotype in understanding who is at risk for developing cardiovascular disease and to determine whether modification of the platelet phenotype can ultimately lower the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.
