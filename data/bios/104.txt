I am internationally recognized for my work on minimally invasive mitral valve repair for degenerative disease, as well as for surgical treatment of ischemic mitral valve insufficiencya complication associated with coronary artery disease. When people come to my office for a consultation, they are often scared and nervous about having surgery. Although I want to show my medical expertise, what I want most is to show that I care and will listen to their concerns. I let them know that they can trust me, I explain what needs to be done, and I walk them through the treatment process. Performing surgeries is just one way in which I aim to help people with heart disease. I have been involved in many clinical trials for mitral valve repair outcomes, minimally invasive cardiac surgery, transcatheter valve replacement, and coronary artery bypass surgery. My own research looks at molecular genomic markers in mitral valve prolapsein which the hearts mitral valves dont work properlyto understand how to determine a persons risk for this condition. I have also invented numerous medical devices for valve repair and replacement. I have published more than 230 manuscripts in prestigious, peer-reviewed journals and have authored numerous book chapters about heart disease.
