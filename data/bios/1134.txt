 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me As an orthopedic surgeon at NYU Langone, I specialize in treating people who have ankle and foot disorders. I am trained in sports medicine, arthroscopy, and foot and ankle surgery. This exceptional skill set allows me to treat patients for a full range of conditions, including fractures, sports-related injuries, degenerative arthritis, tendon disorders, deformities, and limb-threatening complications from diabetes. I often work with professional, collegiate, and amateur athletes. Ive been a consultant to the New York Mets and New York Islanders. I understand the importance of peak performance for athletes and my goal is to help them return to their pre-injury ability. When appropriate, I incorporate arthroscopic or minimally invasive surgery that can limit soft-tissue trauma and decrease recovery time. Im an expert in ankle cartilage, tendon, and ligament injuries, and utilizing innovative technology, such as stem cells, cartilage transplant, and regenerative techniques. I specialize in limb salvage procedures and reconstruction, specifically in patients who have Charcot foot. At NYU Langones Diabetic Foot and Ankle Center , where I serve as director, our team approach provides patients the best chance for successful treatment. My care is patient focused, and I understand that each patient is unique. I explain both surgical and nonsurgical treatment options, if applicable, and believe in shared decision-making with patients. Additionally, I am an assistant professor at NYU School of Medicine where I teach residents and medical students. I am a recognized expert on orthopedic surgery and have lectured nationally and locally.
