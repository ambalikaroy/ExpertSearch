 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me Since childhood, Ive been fascinated with human anatomy and diseases. I was drawn to surgery because the ability to surgically cure people of diseases and cancer is extremely gratifying. Im passionate about offering patients my expertise in minimally invasive and robotic-assisted surgery for benign and cancerous gastrointestinal conditions. With these techniques, patients experience less pain and recover more quickly. As surgical director of the Center for Esophageal and Foregut Health at NYU Langone, I specialize in treating people who have diseases of the esophagus and stomach. I work with my gastroenterology colleagues to provide comprehensive, collaborative care for conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hiatal and paraesophageal hernias, Barretts esophagus, achalasia, and other esophageal motility disorders. At our center, we perform an integrated examination for every patient, involving specialists from advanced gastroenterology, otolaryngology, and pulmonary and allergy medicine to achieve the right diagnosis. We discuss all treatments, from lifestyle changes and behavioral modification to medical, endoscopic, and surgical treatments. For people who decide on surgery as the best treatment, I offer the option of online doctor visits following the procedure. Because I perform minimally invasive and robotic surgery, I dont need to examine patients in person after the first postoperative visit. If they prefer, I can continue to monitor their recovery during online video visits from their homes using the NYU Langone Health app . This allows patients to avoid travel and other unnecessary strain after surgery. I empower my patients by providing them with knowledge about their condition. Together, we choose the treatment option thats optimal for their long-term health. I value the patientphysician relationship immensely and the trust and confidence that patients and their families place in me. I strive to care for them as I would for my own loved ones. I am a fellow of the American College of Surgeons and a member of the Society of Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, the American Foregut Society, and the New York Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. I am a credentialed proctor for robotic surgery and travel nationally to train surgeons in robotic surgery.
