 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me From early childhood, my career goal was always to become a physician. I was inspired by all the doctors Ive known throughout my life. Academically, I was also drawn to mathematics, science, and human biology. I chose to subspecialize in maternalfetal medicine because it provides me the rare opportunity to care for the unique needs of expecting mothers. It also affords me the chance to practice preventive medicine at the earliest stages of human development. I offer advanced ultrasound diagnosis, fetal testing and diagnosis, and management of a wide range of maternal and fetal complications of pregnancy. I believe that physicians should play an active role in educating patients in all aspects of their care. As a maternalfetal medicine subspecialist, my practice provides care for women with medical, surgical, obstetrical, fetal, and genetic complications associated with pregnancy. We focus on the diagnosis and treatment of expectant mothers and their babies. We also provide preconception counseling, consultative services, advanced ultrasound diagnosis, and fetal testing and treatments. We create a partnership with our expecting mothers to guide them and help them navigate any potential high-risk condition that they or their child may face.
