 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me My interest in medicine stems from my childhoodI grew up in a family of doctors and dentists, which influenced my decision to pursue a career in medicine. I chose to specialize in ophthalmology because Ive always been curious about vision and how it is were able to see what we see. During college, I majored in what was then called psychology, but what would now be categorized as neuroscience, with a focus on visual perception. Ophthalmology combines all of my interests. joel-schuman-bio-august-2016 Video Player is loading.

At NYU Langones Eye Center , I treat patients who have a variety of eye conditions, such as blurry vision, cataracts, and glaucoma. I see people who have glaucoma in all stages, from those who are seeking a definitive diagnosis to people whose glaucoma is progressing and require initial or additional surgery. When people do require surgery, Im able to offer them the most advanced and minimally invasive care. The Eye Center is dedicated to patient care and research, so in addition to treating patients, were active in clinical trials to develop new therapies and devices. We are not only using the latest surgical techniques but also pioneering them. Our aim is to provide people with the least invasive treatments for the best possible outcomes. We also prioritize education, and teach residents and fellows to be the future leaders in eye care and surgery. In my own research, I am an inventor of optical coherence technology, which is used to measure eye structures in a noninvasive way. This technology is used around the world and has become the standard of care. For this invention, I am the proud recipient of the Antnio Champalimaud Vision Award, which is the highest honor in the field of ophthalmology.

Research My Research Interests imaging of the eye and visual system, regenerative ophthalmology, aqueous outflow, laser-tissue interactions Read less Research Summary I was named Elaine Langone Professor and Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Ophthalmology at NYU Langone Health , NYU Grossman School of Medicine , in 2020. In 2016 I was appointed Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering , and Professor of Neuroscience and Physiology and a member of the Neuroscience Institute. In 2017 I became Professor of Neural Science in the Center for Neural Science at NYU. In 2018 I was named Professor and core faculty in the newly formed Department of Biomedical Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I served as Chair of Ophthalmology for the NYU Langone Medical Center January, 2016 to September, 2020. Prior to that I served as department chair at University of Pittsburgh/UPMC 2003-2016. I have also been a residency program director and Chairman of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Residency Review Committee for Ophthalmology (2016-2019). I served as Program Chair for the American Glaucoma Society, and founded the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology/International Society for Imaging in the Eye (ARVO/isie, now ARVO Imaging) and the Multidisciplinary Ophthalmic Imaging Group of ARVO. In addition, I co-chaired the International Glaucoma Symposium 1999 2007 and the World Glaucoma Congress 2007 2011. My colleagues and I invented optical coherence tomography, a non-contact, non-invasive high resolution in vivo imaging device now standard of care for clinical use worldwide for the diagnosis and management of eye disease. We also were the first to identify a molecular marker for human glaucoma. I am a busy ophthalmic surgeon and a productive researcher. The NIH has continuously funded me as a principal investigator since 1995. While Ophthalmology Chair at University of Pittsburgh I created the interdisciplinary Fox Center for Vision Restoration at Pitt and UPMC, which joins clinicians, scientists and engineers working in regenerative ophthalmology. I also developed a fellowship program to fund collaboration combining expertise in regenerative medicine and ophthalmology in postdoctoral training.
