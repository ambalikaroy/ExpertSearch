 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me I became interested in medicine as a child growing up in Sri Lanka. During medical school, I trained with neurosurgeons and fell in love with the specialty of neurosurgery for its challenges and the opportunity to help people with complex conditions. After medical school, I moved to London, where I had the privilege of working with top neurosurgeons in the field. I realized that if I wanted to reach my full potential as a doctor, I would have to move to the United States. I was accepted as a resident at NYU School of Medicine and I am now a neurosurgeon at NYU Langone Health. At NYU Langones Spine Center , I treat people who have disorders of the spine and spinal cord, from the base of the skull to the tail bone. I am trained in minimally invasive and endoscopic surgical spine techniques and am the director of minimally invasive spinal surgery. Many of my patients come to me specifically for minimally invasive techniques, which allow for a shorter hospital stay and faster recovery. In some cases, patients can go home the same day and that enables them to return to their everyday activities sooner. When I work with patients, my goal is to understand their condition and discuss all available treatment options. I suggest surgery only when there are no alternative options. I also have expertise in treating people with hyperhidrosisa condition that affects teenagers and young adults and causes excessive sweating from the hands, armpits, feet, head, and face. We provide psychological, medical, and surgical treatment for people with this disorder at our Peripheral Nerve Center . My research focuses on the long-term outcomes of sympathectomy in people with hyperhidrosis. We have been researching some techniques to reduce the incidence of shoulder weakness after neck surgery. I was also instrumental in organizing the first endoscopic course for academic spine neurosurgeons in Cincinnati. Currently, I am a board member of the International Society of Sympathetic Surgery, a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and a member of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.
