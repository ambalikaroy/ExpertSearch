 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I care for people who have conditions affecting the head and neck. This includes problems with the salivary glands, larynx, thyroid, sinuses, pituitary gland, and brain. I also treat patients who have tumors of the mouth, tongue, throat, larynx, and vocal cords. When a person needs surgery that involves the skull base or brain, I use the latest endoscopic, minimally invasive techniques and collaborate with experts in neurosurgery and neuroradiology. I specialize in surgery of the lips, mouth, tongue, and larynx, as well as procedures to manage thyroid nodules, enlargement, and cancer. I have been recognized for my expertise in managing salivary gland diseases, including cancer of the salivary and parotid glands, inflammatory conditions, and salivary stones. Along with my outstanding team at NYU Winthrop Hospital , I perform several key procedures. These include sentinel node biopsy for skin and oral cavity cancer and robotic surgery of the throat and larynx. I believe that top-level expertise and technology is most effectively delivered to patients when they are close to their home, community, and social support network. People who have head and neck cancer have complex and unique needs. My goal is to provide an ideal experience for patients every time I see them. I participate in clinical research through Perlmutter Cancer Center , offering my patients access to novel treatments via enrollment in ongoing clinical trials. Patients often dont realize they can participate in most of NYU Langones clinical trials from Long Island. In my research, I am especially interested in understanding if we can provide simpler surgeries while achieving the same clinical results. I received the Janggen-Phn-Stiftung award in 1998, the Goldblatt Fellowship in 1998, and the Ballantyne research award from the American Head and Neck Society in 2009.
