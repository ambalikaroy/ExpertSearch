 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I was born right here at NYU Langone. I grew up in Staten Island, and then I returned to NYU Langone for medical school, my internship, and my dermatology residency. I was lucky to be mentored by the world-class members of our dermatology department, and I joined the faculty after completing my residency in 2008. Jennifer Stein, MD Bio Video Player is loading.

I am now a dermatologist here, treating people at risk for developing melanoma and those with general dermatologic conditions, such as psoriasis. I see patients who have atypical moles or a large number of moles, as that often indicates a higher risk of melanoma. With imaging techniques such as dermoscopy, I can better detect melanoma and minimize the number of unnecessary biopsies. My graduate research as an MDPhD student focused on understanding how genes control embryonic development. I now perform clinical research and work closely with clinical and basic scientists to better understand melanoma and other types of skin cancer. In 2014, I was honored with NYU School of Medicines Julia Zelmanovich Young Alumni Award for my dedication to the pursuit of medical knowledge and my compassionate patient care.
