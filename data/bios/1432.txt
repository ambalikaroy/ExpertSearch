 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I first came to New York as a medical student at NYU School of Medicine. I am extremely excited to be back and providing care to children in New York City. I am board certified in both pediatrics and dermatology. I cherish the laughter and spontaneity of working with children, who have taught me so much about courage and resilience. It was during my pediatric training that I discoveredand was inspired bythe special relationship a dermatologist has with a family. This is especially true when caring for a child whose skin disorder may impact his or her overall health, quality of life, and self-esteem. I see myself first as a pediatrician. I strive to understand how a childs skin condition is connected to his or her overall medical and psychosocial wellbeing. Within pediatric dermatology, I have clinical and research interests in infantile hemangiomas, vascular anomalies, genetic skin disorders, and the care of children with medically complex conditions.
