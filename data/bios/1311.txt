 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me My mission at NYU Langone is to guide people through the life-changing experience of receiving a cancer diagnosis.

NYU Langone has enabled me to achieve this mission beyond my expectations. I work closely with a dedicated and compassionate team of radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, radiologists, and speech and nutrition specialists at Perlmutter Cancer Center to create the best treatment plans for our patients. My clinical focus is on reconstructive surgery after cancer treatment and on minimally invasive procedures. In addition to treating people who have cancer, I also help to manage a variety of noncancerous head and neck conditions, such as those affecting the salivary glands and parathyroid. In my research, I focus on improving the quality of cancer care and medical education. These interests are directly linked to my goal of providing the best possible care at NYU Langone.
