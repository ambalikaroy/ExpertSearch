 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials About Me As a gynecologic oncologist, the connections I make with my patients are instrumental to their current and future health and wellness. I have enjoyed practicing medicine for decades because it has allowed me to provide innovative care to people who have complex conditions. At NYU Winthrop Hospital and Perlmutter Cancer Center , I treat women who have cancer of the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, peritoneum, cervix, vulva, and vagina, as well as other complex medical and surgical gynecologic issues. I perform minimally invasive, robotic, laparoscopic, and radical gynecologic surgeries, and both standard and complex benign gynecological procedures. I also provide chemotherapy, radiation, and CyberKnife treatment options. My partners and I work together as a team to create individualized treatment plans for each patient. It is my philosophy to treat the whole person, not just the disease. My team and I participate in local, national, and international research to focus on the most advanced, collective treatment possible. We apply the most current clinical trials and molecular and genetic studies to patient care. Additionally, we have written publications, developed new treatment techniques, and provided educational guidance. I have received the Attending of the Year Teaching Award at NYU Winthrop Hospital and am a member of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. I am also a member of Mensa International. I enjoy building relationships with my patients and participating in their care and general wellbeing.
