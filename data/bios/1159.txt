 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me I was drawn to the field of hand surgery because of the breadth of knowledge required to treat a wide range of conditions in people of all ages. Hand surgeons treat people who have issues of the bones, joints, ligaments, muscles, tendons, nerves, blood vessels, and skin of the upper extremities. These are often the result of injuries or other orthopedic conditions. I am passionate about helping people improve their quality of life, and it is a privilege to help them return to the activities that they love. Among the treatments I provide are bracing, casting, splinting, physical and occupational therapy, and surgery. The best outcomes are achieved when patients and I work together to personalize a program that maximizes their recovery. I enjoy being part of a team of doctors and healthcare professionals at NYU Langone, and I often collaborate with my colleagues in physical and occupational therapy, nursing, neurology, internal medicine, and plastic surgery when treating people. I received my orthopedic and specialty training at NYU Langone and am fortunate to now give back to this same community through my involvement in residency and fellowship programs. At NYU Langone I am able to care for my patients and pursue my research interests. Currently, I am researching the outcomes of traumatic injuries to the hand and wrist. I am also able to help guide medical students and residents in their medical training, which contributes to creating better healthcare.
