 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me As a board certified gynecologist at NYU Langone, I specialize in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery and the management of many common health issues affecting women. These include uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, abnormal uterine bleeding, abnormal pap smears, uterine prolapse, and menopause. I also treat women who have received an abnormal Pap test result. In the office, I perform procedures such as loop electrosurgical excision to diagnose abnormal or cancerous conditions, hysteroscopy to examine the uterus, and colposcopy to examine the cervix, vagina, and vulva. I perform all types of surgeries for benign gynecological conditions, such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and ovarian cysts. These procedures include laparoscopic, minimally invasive surgeries, such as myomectomy, hysterectomy, and ovarian cystectomy. In my practice, I emphasize patient education and empowerment. I take the time to ensure that every woman I see understands the details of her condition and has the knowledge to make the best decisions about treatment. As the director of Global Womens Health in NYUs College of Global Public Health, I actively research and raise awareness about global health and womens health issues. I also serve as the president and medical director of Saving Mothers, a nonprofit organization I founded that focuses on womens health, education, and empowerment in low resource regions. My research focuses on interventions that can help to reduce the number of women who die during pregnancy or childbirth around the world. In addition, I have coauthored a book, Around the Globe for Womens Health: A Practical Guide for the Health Care Provider , and am frequently called on for my expertise in womens health by national media outlets, such as CBS News, The Today Show, and Good Morning America. I have been quoted in the Wall Street Journal , Womens Day , Newsweek , and the New York Daily News . Through the treatment I offer to patients, as well as my research and engagement with media outlets, I always strive to be an advocate for women, both locally and globally, and to champion womens health education and self-empowerment.
