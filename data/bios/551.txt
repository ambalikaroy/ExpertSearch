Research My Research Interests heart failure pathophysiology and clinical pharmacology , vascular physiology, iron storage biology Read less Research Summary My research is primarily focused on developing new treatment for a type of heart disease called heart failure. The broad aim of my work is to better understand the causes of exercise intolerance in patients with heart failure and develop new ways to improve exercise capacity and quality of life. In order to determine which medicines and other forms of treatment are most helpful for patients with heart failure, I have served as a Principal Investigator for clinical trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the American Heart Association, and pharmaceutical companies. These studies have led to identification of new treatments that are currently approved by the FDA to improve quality of life and increase survival in patients with heart failure. Currently, my research is focused on several new types of medicines that may help the heart by improving the efficiency of the circulation. Clinical trials are underway to determine if these new medicines can provide additional benefit when used with the current recommended treatments.
