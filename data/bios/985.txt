 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I pursued a career in medicine because I wanted to make a difference in peoples lives. During medical school, I valued close relationships with patients, diagnosing medical conditions, and providing effective treatments. I also had the desire to advance medical knowledge, which led me to pursue a doctorate degree in genetics. Initially, I was drawn to the scientific aspect of reproductive medicine. I was fascinated by the ability to diagnose genetic diseases and screen embryos for chromosomes prior to gestation. Today, I utilize all available resources and stay up to date on the latest advancements to provide patients with a successful path to parenthood. I continue to be inspired by advancements in the fertility field and conduct research to gain a better understanding of the endometrium and implantation process. I treat patients and couples with infertility problems, ranging from anovulatory issues and tubal occlusions to unexplained and male factor infertility. I also focus on fertility preservation for elective and medical reasons and help individuals in the LGBTQ+ community start families. Additionally, I treat menstrual abnormalities and endocrine conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome and hypothalamic amenorrhea. I am skilled in all assisted reproductive technology procedures, including intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF). I also perform hysteroscopic and laparoscopic surgery. When working with patients, I develop treatment options that fit with their ethical, religious, and individual lifestyle beliefs. I develop close relationships with each person, and deliver compassionate and committed patient care. I consider it a privilege to treat and guide patients as we go through this process together.
