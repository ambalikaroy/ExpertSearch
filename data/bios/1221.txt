 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me Growing up, I always knew that I wanted to be a doctor, particularly a surgeon. As a medical student, I was drawn to anatomy and neurology. I found the greatest satisfaction in orthopedics because it allows me to help patients move and regain function through innovative surgical techniques. Within orthopedics I gravitated toward spine surgery and microscopic peripheral nerve surgery, which combined my interests in neuroanatomy and orthopedics with my desire to optimize patient function. Along the way I have developed a national and international reputation in cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal surgery. My clinical expertise includes major cervical and thoracolumbar spinal deformity in adults and children, degenerative spine conditions, and minimally invasive and robotic spine surgery. I have unique dual training in spine and peripheral nerve disorders, and I am also active in NYU Langones brachial plexus surgery program for adults and children. I have been named one of the top spine surgeons at academic medical centers multiple times and have published many articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. I am active in clinical research as a member of the International Spine Study Group, which is composed of leading physicians in cervical and thoracolumbar spinal deformity surgery. I am also an active member of the Cervical Spine Research Society, North American Spine Society, Scoliosis Research Society, and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. I believe a special bond needs to be cultivated between a doctor and a patient. I endeavor to treat every patient as I would want my own family treated, with compassion, dignity, and the highest level of care. As chief of NYU Langones Division of Spine Surgery, these are the principles that I pursue in all my patient interactions, and I encourage all our members to do the same. We are thankful for the opportunity to offer our patients the best in comprehensive spine care.
