I perform a broad range of cosmetic and reconstructive surgery, but my primary focus is breast reconstruction for people who have breast cancer. I offer all forms of breast reconstruction, including implant-based as well as reconstruction that uses a patients own tissue to restore the breast. Depending on patients needs and concerns, I can perform breast reconstruction at different times during their treatment. For some women, I can perform reconstruction on the same day as their lumpectomy or mastectomy, a streamlined treatment known as Breast in a Day. I firmly believe that every person who has breast cancer should have the option of breast reconstruction. For many, it is an essential part of their emotional and spiritual recovery from cancer. I collaborate with breast surgeons and patients to support this aim. Every persons situation and needs are unique, and I keep this in mind to create tailored reconstructive plans that address each persons goals. As a plastic surgeon at NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn , I am proud to contribute to the growing care that is now available outside of Manhattan. I am thrilled that I can provide Brooklyn residents with the highest level of care in the convenience of their own borough.
