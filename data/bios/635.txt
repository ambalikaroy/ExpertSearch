 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me From an early age I had an inquisitive mind and would take on challenging situations, which initiated my pursuit of medicine. I had other careers before I became a doctor, but I knew that something was missing. The field of medicine encompasses many of my passions, including helping people, problem solving, and utilizing technology. As a maternal fetal medicine specialist, I can use my interests and abilities to help patients. Its a privilege to care for patients during difficult pregnancies, and it continues to be the most rewarding aspect of my professional life. I treat women who have complex pregnancies that present complications to the mother, fetus, or both. These medical and surgical problems can be preexisting or new to the patient and the pregnancy. At NYU Winthrop Hospital , I am part of a comprehensive multispecialty team that provides innovative care with the compassion that all patients deserve. We are home to Long Islands only fetal surgery program that offers lifesaving in utero procedures. This care allows pregnancies to continue to later gestational ages so fetuses have a greater chance of survival and fewer complications. We personalize every care plan to the individual patient, and consider all of the important variables that allow for the best possible outcomes. Our patients arepart of the care team and we involve them in all treatment discussions. I treat the patient and pregnancy together. There is nothing stronger than the maternal instinct and the desire for a family to have the best outcome for their newborn. My research interests include cell-free DNA to help maximize the information a pregnant patient can obtain in a noninvasive fashion. I also develop new and innovative ways for our fetal surgery program to treat women with life-threatening fetal conditions. I am also interested in improving how we utilize ultrasound to help screen and diagnosis for fetal conditions. I was recognized by New York Magazine s Best Doctors in New York series in 2014 and 2016, Castle Connollys Top Doctors series for the New York Metro Area in 2016, and Newsday s Top Doctors series in 2014. I am a member of the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.
