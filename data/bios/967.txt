 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me At my maternalfetal medicine practice, I care for women with a wide variety of conditions and needs, including patients with low-risk pregnancies who require routine ultrasound diagnostics, patients with unique medical, social, genetic, surgical, or fetal complications requiring perinatal expertise, and patients with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Maternalfetal medicine focuses on the importance of life, a concept which has held true to my family values from infancy. At NYU Winthrop Hospital , my team and I are in the unique position to help ensure healthy mothers and fetuses. Through a delicate balance of compassion and strength, we are prepared to provide guidance during difficult healthcare decisions. We also offer advanced resources to our patients. I routinely perform chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis, and laboratory and saline sonohysterogram analysis, in addition to taking thorough patient histories, to provide maternal diagnosis. We offer the highest level of perinatal care, with a balance of medicine and compassion. Our team strives daily for the health and family unity of our patients. I have a special interest in clinical and educational research. Clinically, my research interests are vast, however the basic diagnosis of true labor through ultrasound remains a highlight in my career. My goal is to limit unnecessary hospital admissions for those patients not in true labor, to decrease patients hospital stay, risk of cesarean delivery, and other unnecessary interventions. I also hope to decrease their discharge from the hospital when in true labor. I currently serve as the director of the Medical Student Core Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinical Rotation. Im also involved in developing the obstetrics curriculum for NYU Long Island School of Medicine. I strive to help foster a new age of learners and techniques to improve medical education for our future providers.
