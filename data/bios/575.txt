I chose to specialize in gastroenterology and hepatology because as a medical student I had an initial curiosity about the liver that continued to grow. As I learned about the many advancements in treating and managing liver disease, I became more invested in helping people who have this condition. I am particularly passionate about helping those who might feel marginalized or unsafe when receiving medical care, which is why I serve as a volunteer doctor at a homeless shelter. In addition to working with patients, I am passionate about medical education. I set up conferences for hepatology faculty, students, residents, and fellows as part of the hepatology service at NYU School of Medicine, where I also teach classes on gastroenterology and liver disease. Also, I often lecture on various topics related to liver disease within the medical community and speak with patient support groups. I am a fellow of the American College of Physicians and the American College of Gastroenterology, as well as a member of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. I have also written many publications on liver disease, including a recent review on the relationship between platelets and liver disease. It is an honor to have people entrust me with their health. My goal is to develop open, trusting, long-lasting, and caring relationships with my patients.
