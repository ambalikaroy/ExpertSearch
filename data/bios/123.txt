 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I have wanted to be a doctor since I was a child. Prior to becoming a physician, I served as a medic in the Army, so my pursuit of medicine began early in life. During medical school, I developed an immediate interest in cardiology and, specifically, congenital heart disease. Video Player is loading.

I was drawn to the subspecialty of congenital heart disease because it intersects pediatric and adult care. People who have congenital heart disease are born with it. Because of medical and surgical advancements, babies with these conditions are now able to grow and thrive into adulthood. I work with this adult community and help manage these conditions by performing comprehensive examinations to determine the appropriate therapy. Therapies include medications and catheter-based procedures and surgeries. Managing congenital heart disease is a collaborative effort, and I work with a team of specialists at the Adult Congenital Heart Disease Program to provide the most advanced care. Our specialists cover the full scope of congenital patient care, including congenital cardiac surgery, pediatric cardiology, cardiac imaging, pediatric and adult electrophysiology, structural and interventional cardiology, cardiac anesthesia, genetics, maternal fetal medicine, and rehabilitation. We routinely discuss unique and challenging cases to determine the best plan of care. In addition to our medical expertise, each member of our team has a strong understanding of peoples experiences with congenital heart disease. We partner with all of our patients and their families so they can be active participants in their plan of care. I also participate in research and present at national meetings. Currently, I am investigating how heart arrhythmias affect people who have Eisenmenger syndrome. I am also trying to determine if aorta size during childhood in people who have Marfan syndrome is a predictor of aortic complications later in life.
