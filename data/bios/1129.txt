 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I am an orthopedic surgeon with advanced training in surgical and nonsurgical care for patients who have sports injuries. I specialize in treating shoulder, elbow, and knee injuries, with an emphasis on advanced arthroscopic reconstructive techniques of the shoulder, shoulder replacement, knee ligament reconstruction, articular cartilage restoration, meniscal transplantation, and minimally invasive surgery. I provide general orthopedic fracture care for people with traumatic injuries. For people who have osteoarthritis, I also offer advanced orthobiologic therapy, which is nonsurgical injectable treatment, such as platelet rich plasma (PRP) and stem cell therapy.

Before I joined NYU Langone, I worked as an assistant team physician for the Chicago Bulls, Chicago White Sox, and DePaul University Athletics. I provide personalized care to my patients, who range from young high-level athletes and masters level competitors, to weekend warriors and retirees. My goal is to create personalized treatment plans that allow people to return to their normal activities. I offer online doctor visits after patients have had minimally invasive proceduressuch as arthroscopic meniscus surgery or arthroscopic shoulder surgeryto check on their recovery. These video visits help minimize discomfort and inconvenience for patients who may find it difficult to navigate crowded streets on crutches or travel on public transportation during the early postoperative recovery period. These visits are available through the NYU Langone Health app . My office also manages and coordinates care online for patients who have NYU Langone Health MyChart accounts. My lifelong interest in science and sports led me to become a clinicianscientist, and I actively contribute to sports medicine and orthopedic surgery literature. I have published extensively in peer-reviewed journals and I have presented my work at national and international orthopedic surgery meetings. My primary research interests include cartilage restoration, meniscus transplantation, stem cell therapy, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, and clinical outcomes. I have received multiple awards and research grants for my work. I hope to translate research findings into clinical breakthroughs to provide young patients, and those young at heart, with innovative care that will allow them to resume the activities they love and cherish.

Research My Research Interests cartilage restoration, meniscus transplantation, clinical outcome studies, stem cells, ACL reconstruction, knee and shoulder arthritis Read less Research Summary My lifelong interest in the musculoskeletal system and overall functioning of the human body led to my decision to become a clinicianscientist specializing in sports medicine. My role as a clinicianscientist affords me the opportunity to provide patients with compassionate medical care and conduct both basic science and clinical research aimed at improving both the care we provide and the surgery we perform, while also participating in the education of the future leaders in medicine. I actively contribute to the sports medicine and orthopedic surgery literature, and my work has been published extensively in some of the leading orthopedic surgery journals and books. My work has also been presented at countless local, national, and international conferences. My primary research interests include cartilage transplantation and regeneration; meniscus repair and transplantation; stem cells; knee ligament reconstruction; rotator cuff healing; clinical outcome studies; and the management of knee and shoulder arthritis in young, active patients. I have been recognized for my research with multiple awards and honors. My hope is to translate our research findings into clinical breakthroughs that provide patients who are young, and those who are young at heart, with care that enables them to resume the activities they love.
