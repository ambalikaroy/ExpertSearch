 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me As a history major in college, my life plan changed when several close family members fell ill. I quickly realized that the field of medicine was my calling because I wanted to compassionately care for others and improve peoples health. I chose the specialty of radiation oncology to use the latest technologies and advances in radiobiology, computer processing, and physics, to treat people with cancer. I care for patients with malignant and benign tumors that affect the prostate, brain, spine, and gastrointestinal system at Perlmutter Cancer Center . I am trained in innovative radiation techniques, such as stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy, and utilize both robotic and linac-based platforms to provide these therapies. I apply accurate, focused, and technically advanced forms of radiation therapy to minimize doses to healthy tissues. My goal is to deliver compassionate care and to take the time to explain complex therapies in a meaningful way. Communication and collaboration with other specialists is key to developing comprehensive and personalized oncologic treatment. I view patients and their families as partners in their care and encourage their participation to help yield superior results. I have educated other physicians and published articles and presented extensively on the application of stereotactic and image-guided radiation therapy to treat people with malignancies. My research concentrates on optimizing cancer cure rates while maintaining and studying postradiation quality of life parameters. I also have expertise in medical informatics and health sector management to enhance hospital workflow and yield optimized patient-centric therapies.
