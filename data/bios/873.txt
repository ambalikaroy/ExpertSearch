 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations About Me I always found science very intriguing and I always loved children. I cannot think of a better use of science than to help children, which is why I came to specialize in pediatric neurology. It can be challenging to take care of any childeven those without any underlying disordersand that is why I have always admired parents, especially those who take care of children with neurological disorders. I feel fortunate to help these children, as well as their parents, through my knowledge of this specialty. I care for and treat children with epilepsy, neurocutaneous disorders, headaches and migraines, developmental delays, autism spectrum disorder, cerebral concussion, head trauma, macrocephaly and microcephaly, neuromuscular disorders, and attention deficit disorder, among other conditions. My team and I perform routine electroencephalograms (EEG) and overnight ambulatory EEGs with and without video monitoring. We offer these through our office as well as through video EEG monitoring at NYU Winthrop Hospital . We provide patients and parents with personalized attention, care, and compassion, and we thoroughly discuss their concerns. Our office staff is courteous and sincere, and go out of their way to help patients and parents, night and day. I was honored with the Outstanding Attending of the Year Award 2006-2007 from the Department of Pediatrics at NYU Winthrop Hospital and I received the Contribution to Teaching Award in 2001. I am an active member of the Child Neurology Society.
