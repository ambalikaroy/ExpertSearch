 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me As a young child, I had a keen interest in mechanical principles and science. Pursuing a surgical discipline was a natural career choice for me. The specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery fulfills my passion for engineering and medicine. I find this field to be particularly interesting because I collaborate with experts in various specialty areas, including dentistry, plastic surgery, ophthalmology, neurosurgery, and otolaryngology. As a physician who has trained extensively in oral and maxillofacial surgery, I see patients with a variety of head and neck conditions and injuries. I perform facial reconstruction and recontouring and also care for people who have bone or soft tissue injuries to the head and neck, which often require emergency treatment. I specialize in the treatment of facial trauma and the surgical removal of tumors located in the head, neck, and salivary glands. In addition, I extract impacted teeth, place dental implants, and offer dental rehabilitation techniques, including bone volume restoration. This is performed when the jaw has an insufficient amount of bone for the placement of a dental implant. Thanks to my many years of training in different countries, I have experienced and embraced multiple cultures and connected with leading professionals in the field. At NYU Langone, our team includes experts in diverse specialty areas, allowing us to provide comprehensive evaluation and a tailored treatment plan for each patient. I am proud of the relationships I have with my patients and value each of them. I am grateful for the opportunity to provide them with help during a difficult time, so they can go back to their daily life as quickly and easily as possible. To reduce anxiety among my patients, especially among those who may have experienced trauma, I guide them through the steps of their treatment journey. My passion for oral and maxillofacial surgery motivates me to stay updated about the latest developments in the field. I am involved in advanced research on bone regeneration and innovative biomaterials that may potentially lead to novel treatment options. I am a member of the International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons and the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. I also serve as reviewer for the head and neck section of the International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery .
