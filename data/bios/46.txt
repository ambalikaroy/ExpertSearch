 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me My passion for helping people, combined with early patient care experiences, led me to pursue a career in medicine. As a surgeon who performs minimally invasive procedures, I am constantly seeking medical innovation to provide my patients with the best and least invasive treatments. I was one of the first surgeons in the world to perform laparoscopic surgery, a minimally invasive technique, and have spent my career teaching it to other surgeons. Ive operated and taught residents and medical students in more than 60 countries around the world. At NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn , I perform bariatric surgery, gallbladder surgery, thyroid and parathyroid surgery, colon surgery, and surgery for hiatal hernias and many other conditions, using laparoscopic techniques. My extensive experience allows me to provide people with the best and most compassionate care, and my passion for their wellbeing is reflected in all I do. I am thrilled to belong to NYU Langone, an institution that continues to be at the forefront of innovative treatment.
