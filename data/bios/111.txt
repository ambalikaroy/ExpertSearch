 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me As a cardiac surgeon, I specialize in treating valvular heart disease by using minimally invasive and robotic techniques that allow my patients to recover more quickly and with greater ease. In the mid-1990s, I was one of the first doctors to perform minimally invasive mitral valve repair using the Heartport system. This was an exciting advancement. Instead of having to make a large incision in the sternum, surgeons could use a heartlung machine by accessing blood vessels in the thigh. This led to quicker recovery and less discomfort for patients.

This advance led to further innovations, including minimally invasive robotic mitral valve surgery, which I helped to pioneer in the United States and here at NYU Langone. Robotic valvular surgery is a good option for many people because, unlike open heart surgery, it can be performed with pencil-width incisions in the side of the chest. Using small surgical tools, I repair the heart valve and stop the leakage. As part of the robotic heart surgery team , I partner with cardiac surgeon Dr. Didier F. Loulmet . Together we have performed more than 1,000 robotic cardiac operations and 900 robotic heart valve surgeries. I believe that trust and rapport are the most important qualities a person should look for when choosing a cardiac surgeon. I tell my patients Im here to guide them through the process. Through my 40-year career at NYU Langone, Ive focused on doing what I can to help my patients quickly return home to their families and have the least amount of disruption in their lives.
