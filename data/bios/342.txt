 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I chose to become a gastroenterologist because of my personal experiences living with Crohns disease. I was diagnosed as a teenager and struggled to come to terms with it, but I ultimately realized I would have to confront a lifelong chronic condition. As I learned to manage Crohns disease, I gained new insight into a complicated world of medical practice and research. I pursued a medical career to better understand gastrointestinal issues for myself and to provide high-quality care to others. At NYU Langones Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center , I specialize in treating people who have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease. I also treat patients who have gastrointestinal infections, such as Clostridium difficile . At our center, were experienced in caring for patients whose conditions are complex and require exceptionally specialized care. We have the resources and expertise to meet individual needs, and our patients work with a team that may include nutritionists, radiologists, colorectal surgeons, and rheumatologists. With such a wide range of experts, we can provide the most comprehensive and advanced treatment available. My personal experience allows me to offer patients unique insight into managing their care. As a person living with Crohns, I understand the emotional complexity of IBD and can relate to my patients. When I work with them, my aim is to provide the most effective care and connect with them on a personal and empathetic level. In my research, I study malignant and infectious complications of IBD. Specifically, I want to understand how gastrointestinal infections may complicate IBD or trigger it to develop, with the ultimate goal of finding a prevention or cure. I am a member of the Crohns and Colitis Foundation and speak at numerous patient symposiums and international conferences.
