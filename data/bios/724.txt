Being a doctor at NYU Langone allows me to do both. I started working here in 2012, just 48 hours after Hurricane Sandy hit. Teamwork made all the difference as we safely evacuated more than 300 patients. I treat people with disorders of the central nervous system, specifically problems of the brain and spinal cord. Ive been very involved in the study of medications to treat the vision problems experienced by patients with multiple sclerosis. It's an exciting time to be a neurologist, especially at NYU Langone, where weve played an important part in advancing how patients are diagnosed with concussions . Weve studied the King-Devick test to determine if this simple, rapid test, which is administered on the sidelines of youth and college sporting events, can help parents and coaches to determine if a neurological injury has occurred. Its a valuable addition to existing sideline test options, all of which can help to ensure that young patients receive appropriate treatment as soon as possible. I love neurology. Its like a detective story in which you pick up clues everywherefrom the patients history, the examination, the story of the patients journeyand piece together the puzzle to create a customized treatment plan that can lead to the best possible outcomes.
