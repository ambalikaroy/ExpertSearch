 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I decided to become an otolaryngologist while I was a graduate student at The Juilliard School, pursuing a degree in collaborative piano and working with opera singers. I fell in love with the singing voice and became fascinated by how the body creates sound. During this time, I heard Dr. Steven Zeitels lecture on vocal health, and I realized that I could merge my passion for voice with my interest in science and medicine. I work with people to maintain and restore vocal health, so that they can meet all of their vocal demands without restrictions. I consider performers and people who use their voices professionally to be vocal athletes, and just like other athletes, their muscles and tissues require care and maintenance. At the Voice Center s Ambulatory Care West Side location, which is conveniently located near the Theater District and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, voice coaches, physical trainers, vocal trainers, and laryngologists collaborate to help patients maintain vocal health over the course of a lifetime. We treat people who are experiencing any type of problem related to the larynx, ranging from changes in their voice to difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, cancer of the vocal folds, and benign laryngeal lesions. We have advanced equipment to perform comprehensive voice evaluations, including stroboscopic examinations and acoustic and aerodynamic analyses of voice. I am extremely proud that our team at NYU Langone is comprised of experts who are nationally regarded for their clinical and research skills. We all work in vocal health because we are passionate about preserving each patients unique voice over the course of a lifetime.
