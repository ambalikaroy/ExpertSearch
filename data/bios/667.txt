 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me Ive always been interested in science, even as a child. My father was a surgeon, and after seeing his medical accomplishments and the care he provided, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in medicine. During medical school, I found the nervous system to be among the most interesting subjects. As a specialist in multiple sclerosis (MS), I work to treat a disease that affects all parts of the nervous system. The function of the brain and the mind is the core of who we are as human beings, and being able to provide care for this function is one of the most rewarding parts of being a neurologist. My specialty in neurology is treating patients with MS and other autoimmune diseases of the nervous system. Through my training, I learned to treat patients with MS across their lifespans and throughout all phases of the disease. I also see patients with general neurology issues, such as headache and other conditions. As part of the Comprehensive Multiple Sclerosis Care Center at NYU Winthrop Hospital , my team and I provide patients with complete and holistic care for their MS difficulties. We use the most up-to-date treatments to control MS and are also experienced in treating the medical conditions that frequently accompany the disease. We are part of exciting and innovative research that allows our patients to live their lives to the fullest potential. At our center, I am part of a program that includes physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, medical assistants, social workers, and other staff, who are all experienced in addressing the specific concerns of our patients. Through our team-based approach, we ensure that our patients receive the best care available. I believe in targeting treatment to individual patients with MS and making sure that we do all we can to help manage the many varied symptoms that can arise. Because MS is a lifelong condition, I work to establish relationships with my patients so that we can become partners in maximizing their quality of life. I am a member of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Medical Association.
