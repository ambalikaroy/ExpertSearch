 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me For as long as I can remember, Ive been fascinated by the complexity of the human body. It was only natural that I wanted to pursue a career in the medical sciences. I was in high school when the whole world became amazed by the first in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancy. This inspired me to become a reproductive endocrinologist. I see and treat couples who have difficulty conceiving for many different reasons. I trained in a large surgical facility, so I have a special interest in patients who have infertility-related conditions that require surgery. I perform hysteroscopic myomectomies as well as laparoscopic fallopian tube repairs, such as neosalpingostomies and fimbrioplasties, among other procedures. At NYU Winthrop Hospital , we are a large and diverse team of reproductive endocrinologists. We have expertise in all aspects of fertility treatments, from fertility preservation and genetic testing to IVF. I always tell my patients: The right question is not if they can become pregnant. The right question is: What can I do to help them become pregnant?
