 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me As a former athlete, I realize that an orthopedic injury can cause significant physical and psychological pain. I was drawn to orthopedic surgery, and specifically to sports medicine surgery, because I enjoy helping my patients get back to their old performance levels after being sidelined.

At the Sports Medicine Center at NYU Langone Orthopedic Center , I specialize in sports medicine care as well as arthroscopic and open reconstructive surgery of the knee, shoulder, and elbow. Before joining NYU Langone Health, I served on the medical teams of the New York Jets and New York Islanders. In my practice, I give top priority to the physicianpatient relationship and, by extension, patient education. My goal is to build trust with my patients so they feel comfortable with me as their surgeon. I want to ensure people understand their diagnosis, as well as the necessary steps for the road to recovery. I believe in collaborative care, and I encourage my patients to work with me to develop an overall treatment plan. I take the time to explain potential treatment approaches, possible outcomes, and how things will look and feel at all stagesfrom surgery to recovery. Another of my top priorities is teaching students, residents, fellows, and colleagues. I am co-director of the sports medicine fellowship at NYU School of Medicine, and I sit on the educational committees of multiple national organizations devoted to sports medicine surgery. I routinely lecture at national and international conferences and teach surgical techniques at the Chicago-based Orthopaedic Learning Center. I received a traveling fellowship from the Arthroscopy Association of North America in 2017 and in 2018 I was a host for the fellowship. I am actively involved in research and have authored or coauthored many peer-reviewed scientific papers, presentations, and textbook chapters. My research focuses on complex knee reconstruction, including knee dislocations, multiple-ligament knee injuries, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, and revision ACL reconstruction.

Research My Research Interests multi-ligamentous knee injuries , anterior cruciate ligament , ACL, medial collateral ligament , MCL, rotator cuff, shoulder labrum, biceps tendon Read less Research Summary There still exist many clinically significant questions regarding knee instability, including the optimum method of treatment of ACL tears and management of multi-ligamentous injuries of the knee. My research focus in this area includes work designed to 1) Optimize stability in the ACL-deficient knee, 2) Optimize stability in the multiple-ligament injured knee, and 3) Assess clinical outcomes in terms of post-operative ligament surgery functionality, return to work/sport, and overall clinical outcome. Although ACL surgery remains one of the most widely-performed surgeries in the country, pure traumaticknee dislocations with ruptures of multiple stabilizing ligamentsarerare andthere is a relative paucity of information regarding the optimal treatment of those with more pronounced knee instability. My research interests lie in the the management and treatment of complex, multi-ligamentous knee injuries as well as single-ligament injuries such as an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or medial collateral ligament (MCL) tear, as well as studies designed to improve treatment of rotator cuff, shoulder labrum, and biceps tendon.
