 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me I learned a lot about how to be a caring, thoughtful physician growing up as one of nine children in a small home in Queens and later training as an intern and resident in New York City. As a native New Yorker, I feel connected to and energized by the wide range of cultures, ethnicities, and religions I encounter every day. My father was an electrical engineer and my neighbor was a carpenter, and I spent my childhood summers tinkering with the tools in their workshops. Ive always loved working with my hands, and so becoming a surgeon felt like a natural path. At NYU Langone, I treat pediatric and geriatric patientsand everyone in between. I perform a wide array of surgeries, including tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, surgery to place ear tubes and remove congenital neck masses, and microscopic surgery to remove vocal cord polyps and masses, as well as thyroidectomy and parotidectomy. I also offer endoscopic procedures, such as septoplasty, sinus surgery, and surgery to manage obstructive sleep apnea. I love being able to use my surgical skills and my understanding of science, anatomy, and physiology to help people through health challenges with compassion and empathy. Caring for others matters deeply to me, and I cherish the relationships I have with my patients. I find that listening to them is the key to understanding what is going on and knowing how to fix a problem. I often encourage my three children to consider careers in medicine, because I have found such a fulfilling life as a physician. The most satisfying experience Ive had as a doctor is receiving handwritten thank you notes from patients. In addition to teaching medical students and training residents, I participate in several ongoing research projects. My recent studies focus on standardizing clinical hearing tests, laryngeal nerve monitoring during thyroid surgery, and understanding the microbiology of chronic tonsillitis and tonsil hypertrophy. I have lectured internationally on various topics in otolaryngology, including head and neck surgery, thyroid surgery, endoscopic sinus surgery, tonsillectomy, and the management of obstructive sleep apnea. I am a member of the education committee of the American Academy of OtolaryngologyHead and Neck Surgery, and I serve as a reviewer for the journal The Laryngoscope .
