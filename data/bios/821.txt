 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me As a pediatric neurologist and a neuro-oncologist at NYU Langone, I aim to improve the care of children and young adults who have primary central nervous system tumors, peripheral nerve tumors, and neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2genetic conditions that can result in noncancerous tumors. Through clinical and translational research tools and methods, I aim to better understand the natural history of central nervous system tumors with the intention of refining treatment to make it safer and more effective. In 2008, I helped organize the team of physicians at NYU Langone that established the first Comprehensive Neurofibromatosis Center . We currently offer care and clinical trials for children and adults with neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 and schwannomatosis. In 2011, I was the principal investigator for a successful application to become a member of the Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials Consortium, which is funded by the United States Department of Defense and includes 12 institutions within the United States. This affiliation gives our patients with neurofibromatosis access to advanced and innovative clinical trials.

This unique resource facilitates many institutional and collaborative research projects and is funded by grants from the Making Headway Foundation. The Brain Tumor Research Center also facilitates clinical research neuro-oncology protocols, both institutional and cooperative group trials, and actively engages in pharmaceutical collaborations. The NYU Comprehensive Neurofibromatosis Center was initiated in 2008 and is rapidly evolving with acquisition of new staff members. We received a coveted award to become a member of the NF Clinical Trials Consortium in 2011 which offers our patients with NF1 and NF2 access to advanced clinical trials.
