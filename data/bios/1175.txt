 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I have a special interest in treating and improving outcomes for children and adolescents who have hip disorders, such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, and developmental hip dysplasia, an underdiagnosed condition that can lead to the need for hip replacement early in adulthood.

Before I joined NYU Langone as the division chief of pediatric orthopedic surgery at Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone , I trained in the United States and United Kingdom and spent 10 years working as a pediatric orthopedic surgeon in Mexico City. In my practice, I offer a number of surgical procedures, specializing in complex reconstruction of the hip, osteotomies, and fracture care for common pediatric injuries. My philosophy is to approach each child as an individualnot just as a patientand work with his or her family to understand the childs unique circumstances. I strive to listen to my patients and help them achieve their full potential. Nothing is more rewarding than hearing about their achievements after treatment. I am a member of the medical advisory board of the International Hip Dysplasia Institute and serve on numerous committees in professional societies. I am the past president of the Mexican Society of Pediatric Orthopedics. In 2014, I was awarded the prize for best paper during a meeting of the Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons for my research on how periacetabular osteotomya procedure I performimproves outcomes for patients with hip dysplasia.
