 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me I treat women who have benign gynecologic conditions, such as fibroids and endometriosis. Some women come to me for treatment after receiving a misdiagnosis or incomplete treatment. I make sure to spend a lot of time with my patients. I listen to their concerns, symptoms, and treatment needs, and I provide them with the care that they need. As a surgeon, I have always been interested in minimally invasive techniques. This technology is so valuable because it allows people to recover from surgery without the disruptions to life caused by open surgery. After I perform laparoscopy and robotic surgery, patients are often able to go home the same day. Thats important, because I understand that people lead busy lives. At NYU Langone, I have the best resources available, allowing me to provide the highest quality treatments. Our radiologists use the most advanced imaging technology in order to provide accurate diagnoses. I also feel fortunate to work with nurses, physician assistants, and staff who are so efficient and empathic. I am an active member of the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists and a fellow of the American College of Surgeons. I have been published in peer-reviewed journals and have won awards for my research on the causes of endometriosis and how to best treat it.
