 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me As an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in sports medicine, I understand how important staying active and participating in athletics can be for maintaining ones overall health and wellbeing. Personally, I love to play golf, basketball, and softball as much as I can. My mission is to help patients recover from injuries so they can go back to participating in activities that make them happy. I offer my patients innovative surgical and nonsurgical treatments, and help them to completely understand all their available options. I also make sure they understand what to expect during their recovery, so they have a clear picture every step of the way. Eric J. Strauss, MD Eric J. Strauss, MD Bio Video Video Player is loading.

I perform ligament reconstructions, osteotomies, cartilage restoration procedures, meniscus repairs and transplantations, and shoulder labrum and rotator cuff repairs.

My research interests include cartilage repair and restoration, meniscus repair and transplantation, ligament reconstruction techniques, rotator cuff healing, the biomechanics of superior labral tears, and examining how well synovial fluid biomarkers can predict outcomes after knee surgery.
