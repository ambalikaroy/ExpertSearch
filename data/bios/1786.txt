 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me As a child, I knew that I wanted to be a doctor because I wanted to help people. During medical school, I realized I wanted to specialize in reproductive endocrinology and infertility because I wanted to help people have children. I cant imagine anything better in life than helping people experience parenthood. The majority of my patients are women who are interested in knowing their present fertility status, need assistance in becoming pregnant, or both. I also see adolescent girls with irregular menstruation, women who may have or need to be monitored for polycystic ovarian syndrome, women who have Mullerian anomalies, and women who want to freeze eggs or fertilized eggs due to elective or medical reasons, such as cancer, endometriosis, or impending surgeries. I have expertise in fertility preservationboth elective and medical in vitro fertilization, intrauterine insemination, and pre-implantation genetic testing. Our teams mission is to provide high-quality care in an affordable, comfortable setting. I believe patients always come first. I teach residents and medical students, and stress the importance of always listening to patients and working with them to achieve their health goals, such as parenthood.
