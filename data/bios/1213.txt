 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I became interested in the field of medicine because my father was an anesthesiologist.

Today, as an orthopedic surgeon at NYU Langones Spine Center , I treat people who have spine conditions like scoliosis as well as lumbar disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, and other conditions in which the discs and joints wear down. Im a big proponent of minimally invasive surgery when its appropriate. It allows patients to recover quickly and return to the activities they love in a short period of time. Of course, there are instances when minimally invasive surgery is not the best option. I have enough experience to know when it is and is not the best option, and guide my patients accordingly. Im proud to work at NYU Langone and with my colleagues at the Spine Center. In addition to our expertise, we provide nurturing and supportive care. I want to understand not only whats going on in a patients body, but also in a patients life. In addition to my clinical work, I am the director of Quality and Patient Safety in the Division of Spine Surgery and I conduct research in that area as well. When I perform surgery, I make life better for one person at a time. My research allows me to help many people at once. Ive received grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation. I routinely publish in top peer-reviewed journals and present my findings at international academic meetings. I serve on the Safety and Value committee of the Scoliosis Research Society and am an associate editor for the prestigious Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery . For the last three years, I have been named a Rising Star for excellence in spine surgery and patient care by New York Super Doctors .
