 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me While writing my undergraduate thesis, The Public Perception of Doctors in the Early Roman Empire, at Princeton University, I researched the art of medicine and the ways in which physicians have affected peoples lives. Looking at my profession through the lens of history helped me understand how we provide care today and how the practice of medicine has evolved and continues to evolve. At NYU Langone, I practice gastroenterology and see patients as part of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center . Our team, made up of gastroenterologists, surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, and translational researchers, is designed to provide meticulous care to patients while ensuring their needs, and the needs of their families, are met. In the same office environment, we can see patients, administer medication, and perform evaluations in an advanced endoscopy suite. Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease is an incredibly complex process and must be customized to each person. I help to develop clinical care guidelines as part of a committee of the American College of Gastroenterology, but it is also important to understand that there is indeed no cookbook for care. Each person is different, and each persons treatment needs to be tailored to meet his or her needs. My goal is always to match each person to the best type of treatment for that person. Sometimes, when people come to me for treatment, they have exhausted all currently available therapies. I have led clinical trials for emerging medications, and I have also partnered with translational researchers to understand the immunology and biology of ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease, in the hope of developing new therapies and finding a cure. I recently served as the president of the New York Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and am currently a member of the educational committee of the American Gastroenterological Association and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Additionally, I am the chief of medicine at NYU Langones Tisch Hospital , where I work very closely with all the doctors, nurses, social workers, and other clinicians who care for admitted patients.
