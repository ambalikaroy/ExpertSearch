 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I decided to pursue a career as an obstetrician and gynecologist, with a focus on maternalfetal medicine, because I was interested in the origins of human life. I wanted to improve the care provided to mothers and their unborn children through clinical practice and research. I am dedicated to the care of women with high-risk pregnancies. As a maternalfetal specialist, I work with an outstandingteam of specialists to ensure expectant patients and their babies receive the highest-quality care for healthy pregnancies and safe deliveries. I see patients who are pregnant and have various maternal or fetal high-risk conditions. Often, theyre referred to me by their obstetricians and gynecologists. Their high-risk conditions include hypertension, diabetes, obesity, advanced maternal age, in vitro fertilization pregnancy, and fetal ultrasound abnormalities. To optimize the outcome of a future pregnancy, I also offer care and support for non-pregnant women who can benefit from preconception counseling. Such women include those whose past pregnancies involved repeated miscarriages, fetal death, preterm birth, or ischemic placental disease. At NYU Langone HospitalLong Island , we provide a complete array of prenatal diagnostic and therapeutic maternalfetal medicine services, including the first fetal surgery program on Long Island. Our nurse navigator system ensures that expectant mothers meet with any necessary pediatric subspecialists who may provide medical care for their child after they are born. Each patient and child is unique, so each one of our care plans is tailored to meet patients needs during and after pregnancy. I have been teaching residents and fellows and conducting clinical research for the last 42 years. I have published, as primary or secondary author, more than 300 peer-reviewed articles on many maternalfetal subjects. Some of these published pieces have impacted the way we practice obstetrics.
