 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I have always been interested in helping people and learning how things work. I chose to enter into neurology because the brain allows us to perceive the world and ourselves. My team and I have a longstanding commitment to providing excellent medical care to patients in a humanistic, compassionate manner. We believe that people who have multiple sclerosis should be provided with a diagnosis and definitive treatment to stop symptoms as soon as possible. We strive to accomplish this goal as quickly and effectively as possible. I am a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology and American College of Physicians. I have been one of Newsday s Top Doctors on Long Island since 2013, and from 2013 to 2016 I was recognized by Castle Connollys Top Doctors series for the New York Metro Area and New York Magazine s Best Doctors in New York series.
