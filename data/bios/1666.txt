 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I take great pride in providing people with the highest level of foot care, using my experience, best surgical practices, and sensitivity to meet their unique needs and lifestyles. In our practice, we dont treat X-rays, we treat people. My father established our podiatry practice on the Upper West Side in 1959, and I joined him in 1991. My father has since retired, but the practice has remained a fixture of the neighborhood, and weve built strong multigenerational relationships with our patients and their families. In March of 2016, we joined NYU Langone, becoming NYU Langone Podiatry AssociatesUpper West Side . I treat people of all ages who have any foot condition or pain, including bunions, hammer toes, skin conditions, and sports injuries, with an individualized plan of care. I prioritize peoples comfort, which is why I always consider nonsurgical treatments when possible. When people do require surgery, they often seek out our practice because we can perform most procedures in our office. People often think that the recovery process for foot surgery will be painful; however, I use techniques to reduce postoperative swelling and pain. I have authored articles and textbook chapters on foot surgery and proudly served as president of the New York Division of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons for six years. I am excited to be part of NYU Langone and continue to provide the highest level of care.
