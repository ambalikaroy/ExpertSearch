 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I come from a family of doctors, but I wasnt always interested in becoming a physician. My first job out of college was writing advertising and marketing materials for pharmaceutical companies. I enjoyed the process of taking complex medical phenomena and breaking them down into easily understandable information. However, I eventually realized that I wanted to be directly involved in taking care of people. After six years in advertising, I went to medical school. What I love most about the field of radiation oncology is the quality of the relationships that I can form with my patients. I understand that treating cancer is not just about being able to offer the most advanced forms of treatment; its about understanding a patients individual needs and forming a partnership to help meet those needs. Whether I am the first specialist a patient is seeing or the last, I strive to provide the compassion patients need when faced with such a diagnosis. While radiation has been used to treat cancer for more than a century, the new technology and developments I have access to ensure that I am able to offer patients more effective treatments than ever. At Perlmutter Cancer Center , I am pleased to be able to offer my patients some of the most advanced technology in the field of radiation oncology. My team and I are internationally recognized leaders in using Cyberknife, and I have been extensively involved in research furthering the application of stereotactic and image-guided radiotherapy.
