 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me The field of gynecologic oncology combines the aspects of medicine that fueled my decision to become a physician. I am able to establish a relationship with my patients and provide them with advanced care, while helping them move past illness. Today, I am excited to be involved in innovative advances in surgery and treatment to help women with gynecologic cancers live long, productive lives. At Perlmutter Cancer Center , I diagnose and treat gynecologic malignancies, including uterine, ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancers. I also provide care to women with genetic predispositions to developing cancer, such as BRCA mutations and Lynch syndrome. Additionally, my practice offers expert consultation for women affected by precancerous conditions and complex gynecologic conditions, such as endometriosis. The individual needs of each of my patients drives my desire to provide compassionate and personalized care. As the director of the gynecologic oncology division at NYU Winthrop Hospital , part of NYU Langone Health, I work with a team of world-renowned specialists to deliver a full range of comprehensive cancer care to patients. Depending on the diagnosis, I can offer a variety of treatment options ranging from chemotherapy and targeted cancer therapies, to minimally invasive and robotic surgeries. I also provide radical debulking procedures for patients with advanced cancers. I am involved with various clinical trials assessing targeted therapies, cancer vaccines, and immunotherapy. I encourage my patients to participate in these trials to ensure they receive the most up-to-date treatment options available.
