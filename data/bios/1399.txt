 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me Ive always been fascinated by how our brains allow us to think, move, and experience the world, and how these seemingly universal abilities can be significantly impacted by brain disorders. My interests led me to receive training in both clinical skills and basic experimental sciences of movement disorders. As a physicianscientist at NYU Langone, I provide care for people who have Parkinsons disease and related movement disorders, including tremor, tics, dystonia, and Huntingtons disease, using the best available treatments. Im the director of translational research at the Fresco Institute for Parkinsons and Movement Disorders at NYU Langone, where I strive to learn more about how disease affects patients in their daily lives on an individual level. I apply my knowledge and clinical bedside experience to my research to further discover the underlying mechanisms of disease. These insights help me understand what patients experience, so I can provide them with the best possible approach to care. Before joining NYU Langone, I created and led a multidisciplinary team of basic researchers and clinical experts at the University of Chicago for two decades. More recently, I was the chief of the division of movement disorders in the Department of Neurology at Columbia University.

Research My Research Interests Parkinson's disease, movement disorders, basal ganglia circuit, neural plasticity, catecholamine, biomarkers Read less Research Summary My research is a part of multidisciplinary effort by a team of basic and clinical scientists to understand the mechanisms underlying Parkinsons disease (PD) and related movement disorders. I pioneered experimental gene therapy approaches to replace dopamine for PD. My laboratory researchnow focuses on understanding how brain circuitry is perturbed by the dopamine loss and bypharmacological treatment in mouse models of PD. We hope to understand the mechanisms of exercise, rehabilitation, medication, and surgical intervention in PD. We are also exploring circuitry mechanisms underlying gait and freezing and non-motor symptoms of PD that have not been adequately addressed by the current therapies. In addition, we are interested in the molecular dysfunctions that contribute to neuronal degeneration in PDand translating this knowledge into PD-specific biomarkers that can help us to predict, diagnose, and understand heterogeneity of Parkinsons disease better. These tools may allow us to improve our individualized care of patients and facilitate the development of new therapies.
