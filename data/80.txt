 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I became fascinated with the specialty of plastic surgery after listening to a lecture during my training as a medical student. Plastic surgery seemed to be a perfect blend of two of my passionsscience and art. My patients often tell me that I am an artist. As a cosmetic and breast plastic surgeon at NYU Langone and Perlmutter Cancer Center , I offer breast reconstruction for people who have been treated for breast cancer and also perform surgery for cosmetic problems on the face, breast, and body. I specialize in all types of breast reconstruction, including reconstruction using implants and autologous, or flap, reconstruction, which uses a patients own tissue. I am a skilled board-certified surgeon with more than 20 years of experience. My treatment philosophy is simpleI listen to my patients and I strive to deliver the best care possible using my expertise and the latest techniques. I consider it a privilege to care for my patients, and my medical team delivers responsive, personalized care that is tailored to meet their requirements. As a recognized leader in aesthetic breast reconstruction, I have been invited to speak at many national and international conferences, including the London Breast Meeting and the World Society for Reconstructive Microsurgery. I am active in clinical research for developing safer breast implants and minimally invasive breast surgery. I have published numerous articles in peer-reviewed journals and have contributed to many book chapters. I am a co-director for NYU Grossman School of Medicines Breast Reconstruction State of the Art course. I am a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, and the American Association of Plastic Surgeons. I am also an examiner for the American Board of Plastic Surgery. I have been named one of Castle Connollys Exceptional Women in Medicine 2019 and Top Doctors: New York Metro Area every year since 2012. I was also named one of New York Magazines Best Doctors for six consecutive years.
