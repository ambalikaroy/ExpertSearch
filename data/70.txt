 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me Being able to contribute to the field of surgery is a privilege. Every day I have the opportunity to influence and change the lives of patients, medical students, residents, and fellows. I joined the NYU School of Medicine faculty in 1991 and am thankful for the opportunities that opened up to me as NYU Langones first female attending surgeon. I am proud to have led the way for other female surgeons and attribute my success to being taught that if I persevered, I would succeed. I treat people who have breast cancer and benign diseases of the breast, offering advanced, individualized, and compassionate care. Managing breast cancer is a team effort, and at Perlmutter Cancer Center , I am fortunate to work closely with outstanding colleagues in breast imaging, medical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, nuclear medicine, clinical genetics, social services, and other specialties. This personalized team approach allows me to provide my patients with optionsI can tailor treatment and prevention strategies to each persons unique needs. I am actively using new techniques and technology for breast cancer surgery, including the MarginProbe a device used to detect cancer cells in healthy tissue during breast surgeryto reduce follow-up procedures. I also use the SAVI SCOUT system, which eliminates the need for people to have an additional radiologic procedure the day of surgery. I am also skilled in pain management techniques to minimize discomfort after a mastectomy. My research interests focus exclusively on breast cancer, including disparities and racial differences in breast cancer outcomes, the evolving role of mammographic screenings, surgical techniques, and the biology of breast cancer. I have published more than 200 peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, and abstracts.

Locations and Appointments NYU Breast & Surgical Oncology 160 East 34th Street, 4th Floor New York, NY 10016 Phone 212-731-5347 View Map Request an Appointment Research My Research Interests diseases of the breast, nipple sparing mastectomy, breast cancer, surgical innovations Read less Research Summary My research has focused on clinical problems in surgery. An ongoing interest throughout my career has been the overlap of societal structure and disease. Early on, this included trauma and surgical infections, clinical challenges posed by tuberculosis, the effects of HIV on trauma and breast cancer, sex and surgical outcomes, and domestic abuse. I also had the opportunity to participate in seminal studies at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue regarding the management of solid-organ injuriesparticularly hepatic and splenic injuries. As I narrowed my clinical practice to breast disease, my research interests now focus exclusively on breast cancer, and I have published more than 200 peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, and abstracts. An ongoing collaborative project with the Hansjrg Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery and the Breast Surgery Section involves a critical evaluation of our experience with nipple-sparing mastectomies. To date this project has resulted in 14 abstracts and poster presentations and 5 papers. I have been active in the adoption of new techniques and technology for breast cancer surgery, currently including the MarginProbe radiofrequency-based device for intraoperative lumpectomy margin evaluation, which can reduce re-excision rates in breast-conserving breast cancer surgery, and an institutional review boardapproved clinical trial evaluating the SAVI SCOUT system for nonradioactive seed localization of breast tumors. Additional academic interests of mine include other surgical techniques, disparities and racial differences in breast cancer outcomes, the evolving role of mammographic screening, and the biology of breast cancer. I have had the opportunity to collaborate with Mei Fu, PhD, RN, FAAN, of the NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing since 2008, focusing on lymphedema diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. This research incorporates qualitative and quantitative methods, genomic and biomarker approaches, and cutting-edge measurement technology, as well as innovative behavioral interventions. Our most recent study, which began enrolling patients in June 2015, offers breast cancer survivors a tablet-based self-assessment for lymphedema.
