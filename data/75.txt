 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me I am fortunate to be a breast surgical oncologist at a time when we are witnessing remarkable progress in cancer care. I am even more fortunate to be able to contribute to this progress through my research and the care I provide. My patients are women and men who have received a breast cancer diagnosis. I also see people who are at high risk of breast cancer, because of family history or genetic predisposition, and those who have benign diseases of the breast. I have many years of training in minimally invasive breast surgery techniques. I am fellowship-trained and have worked with leading researchers, such as Nobel Prize laureate Gnter Blobel, MD, PhD, and Stanley Dudrick, MD, a renowned surgeon who pioneered intravenous nutrition. In addition, I was responsible for starting the first multidisciplinary breast center in an underserved area in East Brooklyn. I specialize in breast conservation surgery and nipple-sparing mastectomy techniques that improve medical and cosmetic outcomes. I am trained in a mastectomy technique called tumescent dissection that makes it easier for plastic surgeons to do any type of breast reconstruction. I also use a hidden scar surgical technique to remove cancerous tissue using a very small incision, which allows for any scarring to be hidden. As part of NYU Langones Perlmutter Cancer Center , I work with a multidisciplinary team of specialists that provides the best standard of comprehensive care. I take a personal approach to care, treating each patient like a member of my family. Through my research and clinical trials, I am able to provide patients with additional treatment options. I am currently developing new scissors to improve surgical techniques for mastectomy and looking for new tumor biomarkers that can help doctors to detect cancer earlier, using a diagnostic blood test. In addition, I am researching the biological factors contributing to the health disparities and higher incidence of breast cancer in certain populations, including within the Black community. I am fluent in multiple languages, including Russian and Czech, and involved in community outreach to countries around the world, with the goal of spreading awareness about screening and the diagnosis of breast cancer. I am a member of the American College of Surgeons, the American Society of Breast Surgeons, and the Society of Surgical Oncology. I was selected to be a global mentor by the We Are Family Foundation in 2019.
