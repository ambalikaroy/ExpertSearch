 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me As a cardiologist, I treat people who have conditions that cause abnormal heart rhythm. I was drawn to electrophysiology because it beautifully combines the solid principles of exact sciences with the art of practicing medicine. At NYU Langone, I feel Im at the apex of cardiac electrophysiology carewere often the first to access the latest technologies, and its gratifying to know that I can offer my patients the best treatment available.

As director of the Inherited Arrhythmia Program at NYU Langones Heart Rhythm Center , I care for people who have hereditary heart conditions, such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome. These are complex conditions that may increase a persons risk of developing a dangerous, abnormal heart rhythm called arrhythmia. Diagnosing and treating an inherited arrhythmia requires a comprehensive investigative approach. We use genetic tests, advanced rhythm monitors, imaging with high-resolution MRI, and patient-specific pharmacological and physical challenges to accurately define each persons condition. When indicated, we may use highly advanced navigation and mapping systems to visualize and understand what is happening inside the heart. Because certain arrhythmias are heritable, I have the opportunity to work with large families across generations. Sometimes, family members are hesitant to learn about their genetic background. My team and I make a special effort to provide this important information in the most sensitive manner. We offer screening to a patients parents, siblings, and children, and if they carry the same gene, we can monitor and treat them if necessary. For people who require treatment for an arrhythmia, I use an array of techniques and treatments to provide the best possible outcome. These may include specific anti-arrhythmic medications and catheter ablation, where I use targeted energy to eliminate irregular electrical activity in the heart. For some people, treatment includes cardiac devices such as an implantable pacemaker or defibrillator. I strive to use minimally invasive and cosmetically conscious surgical techniques wherever possible. My goal is to help my patients understand their condition, relieve their fears, and make the genetic condition they have more tolerable and compatible with a good life.
