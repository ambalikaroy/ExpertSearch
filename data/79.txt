Locations and Appointments NYU Langone Hospital Brooklyn 150 55th Street Brooklyn, NY 11220 Phone 718-630-7000 View Map Research My Research Interests patient navigation, community-based navigation, breast cancer, underserved populations, health care disparities Read less Research Summary The overall goal of my clinical research and academic endeavors has been to examine health care disparities and strategies to improve outcome in underserved women affected by breast cancer or at increased risk for breast cancer. Despite the improved survival rate for breast cancer patients over the past several decades, the mortality rates for sub-groups, especially African-American women have not changed and a gap remains. My research has primarily focused on why these gaps exists, with my efforts primarily in the clinical and community based settings. I am also co-director of the Bea Welters Breast Health Outreach and Navigation Program which serves to improve outcomes for underserved women with breast cancer by reducing barriers to quality care by advancing an effective and scalable community-based navigation model for reducing disparities in screening and diagnostic follow-up care in medically underserved women, improve access to and use of high quality breast cancer care and supportive services at Bellevue, Tisch and NYU Lutheran hospitals among underserved women utilizing patient navigation and to increase access to and participation in clinical trials for the most promising and innovative therapies for breast cancers among underserved women.
