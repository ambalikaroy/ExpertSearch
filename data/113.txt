We are one of only a handful of medical centers in the country with a specialized programthe Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Program that meets the needs of people who have been diagnosed with this condition. As director of the program, I bring years of experience to the medical and surgical treatment of people who have this condition. I perform myectomy, the surgery for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as simultaneous mitral valve repairs when necessary. I also specialize in a procedure called total arterial revascularization, which restores the blood supply to the heart in people who have coronary artery disease. Like many cardiac procedures, this type of surgery is complex and requires a team approach. I work closely with anesthesiologists, critical care physicians, and other specialistssome of the most caring people I have ever had the privilege of working with. Together, we provide personalized care to each person. My team and I also study the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in order to better understand how we can help our patients. We are currently conducting stem cell research in the hope of finding a possible cure for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
