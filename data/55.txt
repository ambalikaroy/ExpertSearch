 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I began my journey into medicine at a very young age. When my mother passed away, it prompted me to look at the world and evaluate what I could do to prevent that from happening to another little girl. I knew that I wanted to make a difference and felt that being a surgeon was the best way for me to implement a more immediate change. I found minimally invasive and robotic surgery to be innovative, revolutionary, and fun. I especially believe that bariatric surgery improves patients lives from a systematic point of view, because it impacts every organ system. My patients range from having terrible acid reflux to morbid obesity. I perform gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgeries, along with hiatal hernia repairs. I use small keyhole incisions for these procedures. I want patients to realize that bariatric surgery is a very useful tool. However, it should not be treated as a miracle procedure. Surgery is an excellent option for our patients, but they still need to actively participate in their care and continue to follow lifelong lifestyle changes to actively lose and maintain their weight loss. We have a comprehensive bariatric program at NYU Winthrop Hospital , complete with dedicated nurses, nurse practitioners, nutritionists, and physician assistants, who care for our patients from throughout the whole process. We have a very active support group that ensures successful outcomes and has a proven track record. We support patients every step of the way.
