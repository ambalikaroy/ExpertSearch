Connecting with families is an integral and important part of the care process. Most often, parents want to know if or how a condition will affect their childs future and overall development. I sit down with each family and address their concerns at length, encouraging them to ask questions. Educating families is a key element of my work, and I take the time to provide them with as much information as possible. I tell parents that we will do everything within our capabilities to ensure children can go home and live normal, happy lives. Infants and children deserve the best possible care. As the surgical director of the Pediatric Heart Failure and Transplant Program , part of the Pediatric Congenital Heart Program , I oversee surgical care for children with heart failure that is unresponsive to standard medical therapy. At Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone , we have the facilities and expertise to provide mechanical devices to help support the heart and manage heart failure. We also provide heart transplant for children with heart failure when this is deemed to be the best option. Surgical options for treatment of congenital heart disease and heart failure are advancing rapidly, and I am happy to bring these innovations to my care. I consider it a great privilege and a blessing to be able to make a difference in the lives of children and families. A good day for me is when a procedure goes as planned and the child does well after surgery. A great day is when, on top of that, I learn something new from my patient and become a better surgeon.
