 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me My interest in medicine was influenced by my father, who is a physician. As a child, I often accompanied him to the hospital. I developed an interest in the physiology aspect of biology, and frequently asked my father questions about the heart. This early curiosity evolved into a dream of becoming a heart surgeon, because I was drawn to the life-saving work of the specialty. I feel privileged to be fulfilling my dream as a doctor, and performing heart surgery allows me to give back to society. Video Player is loading.

My expertise is in treating people who have end-stage heart failure and performing related surgical procedures, such as heart transplants , at the NYU Langone Transplant Institute . I was drawn to heart transplantation early in college, impressed by what it offers patients and how it positively impacts their lives and the lives of their families.Additionally, I perform lung transplantation for patients. I believe that everyone deserves world-class care. I want patients to know that we are here for them and will treat each of them as a person, not a condition. I try to consider every aspect of my patients lives; theyre like family members to me. Without empathy and compassion, medicine becomes like an assembly line moving from one patient to another. At NYU Langone, our team is comprised of multiple specialties, which allows us to be involved in all areas of our patients care. When I meet patients, I present them with all of their options, discuss their needs, and help them choose a treatment plan that is best for them. Not everyone requires surgery. Everyone has different needs, and treatment plans should reflect this. My research passion lies in the creation and application of circulatory support pumps to assist the heart, so that someday we can move away from heart transplants. Not everyone is a candidate for a heart transplant, and pumps may provide effective care for a greater number of people.
