As a cardiothoracic surgeon at NYU Langone, I care for patients with advanced and end-stage heart and lung disease. This can include the use of artificial life-support devices and removal of clot (pulmonary embolectomy) and scar tissue (pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, or PTE) from the arteries of the lungs. At the NYU Langone Transplant Institute , I work with patients who require heart transplantation and lung transplantation . Because of the advanced stage of my patients conditions, many of them have been told that no further treatment options are available. It is incredibly rewarding to be able to help these patients, as I believe all people deserve access to the highest quality of care and the chance to improve their health. I am committed to providing my patients with both of these. The most gratifying part of my job is helping patients and their families regain hope. I am humbled and honored to be able to help people return to their daily lives with their loved ones. For this reason, I am grateful to be part of a truly multidisciplinary team at NYU Langone. We take the whole person into account, providing him or her with the utmost care and respect. In addition to my clinical work, I conduct research to improve the treatments and care available to my patients. My current research focuses on how minimally invasive surgery can decrease pain, recovery time, and the risk of complications.
