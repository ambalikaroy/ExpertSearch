 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me I was accustomed to being the black sheep in my familythe quiet violinist among rambunctious athletes and sports fanatics, the lone doctor in a family of lawyers. I was drawn to medicine and, specifically, obstetrics and high-risk obstetrics, because it is such a unique area. Not many specialists focus on caring for women who are pregnant and have issues that can affect the mothers health. Pregnancy is such a special time in a womans life, but when there is an added high risk from complications, it can be a confusing and frightening time. At NYU Langone, where we have the resources of a large academic center while offering personalized care, a team of diverse specialists manages pregnancy complications. Women may be seen by cardiologists, pediatric cardiologists, pediatric surgeons, rheumatologists, endocrinologists, anesthesiologists, pediatric geneticists, and other experts. We have regular meetings to discuss the highest risk cases and make sure there is a detailed plan for the care of these women and their babies. We communicate constantly with other subspecialists, including pediatric and maternal subspecialists. We perform the full breadth of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, including chronic villus sampling, amniocentesis, fetal transfusion, and procedures to manage a complicated multiple pregnancy. I believe its important to individualize care. While we have experience with all the issues that may arise during pregnancy, these issues often present themselves in different ways. We know that what is right for one woman and her family may not be right for others. Ive received numerous awards for teaching residents and medical students, as well as awards for my research. In terms of recognition for patient care, Ive been included in the Best Doctors in America database since 2007, Castle Connollys Top Doctors list since 2013, and the Super Doctors database since 2015. My research on the prediction and prevention of preterm birth, which has resulted in more than 70 manuscripts, has appeared in many top obstetrics and gynecologic journals. I have been invited to speak regionally and nationally on a variety of maternal fetal medicine issues.
