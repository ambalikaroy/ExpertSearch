 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me When a child has a significant heart condition, the diagnosis impacts the entire family. As a pediatric cardiologist, I make a point of listening to everyonethe child, parents, but also siblings and other loved ones. I want to understand a familys concerns, help them navigate this new world, and give them hope. I care for children who have cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, or other serious conditions that can lead to heart failure and possibly transplant. The number one question parents have for me is, What will the future look like for my child? Can they go to school? Play sports? What will their everyday experiences, and those of the family, be like compared to others? Its important to me that I understand the entire familys concerns and goals because we accomplish more when everyone is a part of the childs care. Rakesh Singh Bio Vid_V3 Video Player is loading.

The most important thing I tell families is based on what I have seen in my practice: The odds strongly favor your child living a long, healthy life. Most children with heart disease respond very well to treatment, and I have been fortunate enough to watch many of my patients grow into adulthood. Thats not to say the road isnt filled with bends and curves. Some forms of complex heart disease are managed well with medications and routine doctor visits. But, for some children, heart disease can progress to heart failure. When that happens, a heart transplant may be the best treatment. The good news is that the vast majority of children do very well after a heart transplant and lead active lives. As the medical director of the Pediatric Heart Failure and Transplant Program, I am in charge of all aspects of a childs care, including managing outpatient heart failure medications, coordinating ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy for children awaiting heart transplant, and overseeing the transplant process. I also work closely with our support team, which includes a social worker and child life specialist, to ensure the social and emotional needs of your child and family are met. I grew up in a large family and had the opportunity to watch younger cousins grow, aspire, and achieve. As a pediatric cardiologist, I bring that satisfaction to my work life. I have patients I cared for as infants who are now teenagers and young adults. They send me picturesone even went skydiving! And thats exactly why I do what I do, so children can grow into adults who can live out their dreams.
