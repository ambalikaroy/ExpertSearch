The field of rhinology, a subspecialty of otolaryngology, has evolved in recent years, as has my own practice. Along with managing common sinus and nasal conditions, I now perform endoscopic transnasal skull base surgery. This type of procedure is usually performed by a team of otolaryngologists and neurosurgeons and offers a minimally invasive approach to the management of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and skull base lesions, such as pituitary tumors. At NYU Langone, we always use a team approach. The team includes everyone the patient meets when coming here for treatmentfrom the staff he or she interacts with upon arrival, to the nurses, residents, anesthesiologists, specialists, and surgeons in the operating room. All of these experts have something in common: They all put patients wellbeing first. Working together, we decide on the best treatment for each person. As part of an academic medical center, my colleagues and I are involved in both training and research. This gives us a unique mindset when it comes to patient care. Rather than having a set way of doing things, we are constantly evaluating the way we diagnose and treat patients, searching for ways to improve our practice. NYU Langone also provides opportunities to collaborate on research projects with other specialists to find ways to improve outcomes for patients. I work with microbiologists to understand the causes of chronic sinusitis and how we can better manage it. Ive also worked with our neurosurgeons to improve our approach to skull base procedures.
