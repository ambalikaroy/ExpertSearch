 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I pursued a career in medicine because I was fascinated by the complexity of the human body and appreciated making a positive and lasting impact on peoples lives. I chose my specialty of reproductive endocrinology and infertility because I was intrigued by the complex physiology and science. Today, I continue to find satisfaction in helping couples and individuals achieve their desire to build families. I see a variety of patients, including same-sex couples and women or couples electing for egg donation, surrogacy, or both. I also see women attempting to preserve their fertility through embryo or egg freezing. Additionally, I provide preimplantation genetic diagnosis to women and couples who are at risk for transmitting a genetic disease to their offspring. I perform surgical and medical treatments necessary to help patients achieve their fertility goals, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemination (IUI). I also perform minimally invasive surgeries, such as hysteroscopies and laparoscopies to treat infertility, including the removal of fibroids, ovarian cysts, uterine polyps, and tubal surgeries. We tailor our treatment and management for each individual and couple based on their unique medical and social circumstances. Our dedicated medical team cumulatively has more than a century of experience and practices in a compassionate, professional, and nonjudgmental manner. I have been and continue to be involved in research pertaining to the health of the placenta, male fertility, and reproductive aging and fertility preservation. I am a member of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
