 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me My commitment to medicine was solidified when, at a young age, I lost several family members to cancer, including a beloved uncle who passed away from lung cancer at the age of 41. Perhaps as a result of these experiences, I view my patients as an extension of my family and circle of friends. Our team is centered around our patients and their families. Were committed to providing them with the very best in screening, diagnosis, and treatmentguiding them throughout the whole process.

I was attracted to gastroenterology because I realized I could help people who had complex illnesses, such as gastrointestinal cancers, by performing procedures and providing ongoing clinical care. Because my grandfather had colon cancer, I also liked the idea of raising awareness for colon cancer screenings and prevention. As a gastroenterologist and advanced endoscopist, my expertise is in screening people for cancer and diagnosing and treating them for complex gastrointestinal conditions, such as cancers, precancerous conditions, and difficult to find gastrointestinal bleeding. I perform endoscopic procedures including colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and double balloon enteroscopy. I also perform endoscopic procedures for Barretts esophagus, such as radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation. In my research, I evaluate new technologies to improve our ability to screen for, diagnose, and treat cancerous and precancerous gastrointestinal conditions. I believe in preventive care and in encouraging people to take care of themselvesincluding getting screened for colorectal cancerbefore symptoms occur. When people dont feel well, I advise them to listen to their bodiesor their guts, so to speakand see a doctor. And finally, if they are diagnosed with a serious illness, I encourage them not to get caught up in negative statistics. There is always hope and there are always options. No matter what the problem may be, we will get through it together.
