 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials About Me I was always interested in science as a child, but I also had a deep love for the performing arts, specifically dance. During my freshman year of college at NYU Tisch School of the Arts, I realized I could combine these passions through the specialty of sports medicine. As a primary care sports medicine specialist, I treat people who have a variety of musculoskeletal conditions, including knee and shoulder injuries, rotator cuff syndrome, osteoarthritis, wrist fractures, bursitis, and many others. I see both athletes and nonathletes of all ages and skill levels at NYU Langones Sports Medicine Center . From my training in primary care family medicine, Ive learned to see my patients as more than just a swollen knee or a fractured finger. I believe it's important to step back and look at a person holistically. This allows me to see what medical or social issues my patients might have as a result of or in addition to their injury. I try to take these issues into account and provide a treatment plan that addresses all of their needs. My goal is to keep people active, encourage them to lead healthy lifestyles, and help them return to the activities they enjoy.
