 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I was interested in the biological sciences in high school, which led me to volunteer at a hospital during the summers and work in a local doctors office. These experiences fueled my desire to become a physician. In medical school, I was fascinated by womens endocrine issues and reproductive health and this led me to specialize in obstetrics and gynecology and reproductive endocrinology and infertility. I value my role as a physician who treats women with these medical problems. It has allowed me to help so many women, and men, build their families. Most of my patients are trying to conceive a child. I also treat conditions including anovulation, polycystic ovarian syndrome, decreased ovarian reserve, premature ovarian failure, tubal blockage, endometriosis, recurrent pregnancy loss, and male factor infertility. As the director of Third Party Reproduction, I treat patients who want to conceive through egg donation or surrogacy. I care for and help same-sex partners who want to conceive through intrauterine insemination with donor sperm or reciprocal in vitro fertilization (IVF). I also see patients who are carriers of genetic disease and want preimplantation genetic testing of their embryos prior to conception and patients who have recently been diagnosed with cancer and want to preserve their fertility by freezing their eggs or sperm. Additionally, I see women who want to evaluate their fertility and preserve their fertility through elective egg freezing. NYU Langone Reproductive Specialists of New York is proud to be an open-minded and welcoming practice. My team and I treat patients in a warm and caring environment and recognize the delicate and personal nature of the work that we do. Our doctors have expertise in all areas of infertility and our nursing staff and embryology and andrology departments are highly skilled. Our receptionists are sensitive to the pressures that our patients face and our finance department works to help resolve billing issues so that patients can complete their treatment cycles. We believe in open communication with patients and guide them through this very difficult time with compassion and understanding. We all work as a team. I enjoy working with my patients and helping them complete their journey to parenthood. I believe in giving each of my patients the necessary time required to perform a detailed evaluation, explain the proposed treatment, and answer each of their questions. Every day I strive to provide my patients with the highest quality of care. My goal is to treat the whole patient because I believe a healthy mind and body helps to achieve a healthy pregnancy. My clinical research activities focus on general fertility management and treatment outcomes in order to provide patients with the best care and shortest time to pregnancy. My interest in ovarian reserve testing led to developing a medication dose protocol to optimize IVF cycle response and allows me to set realistic expectations for my patients. By treating a diverse patient population, I have learned to tailor treatments to optimize success. I am the medical director of our practice. I am also a fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and a member of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, the Nassau Obstetrical and Gynecologic Society, and the Hellenic Medical Society.
