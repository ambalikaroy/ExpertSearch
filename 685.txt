 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me One of the things I realized early in my life is that there is no greater joy than relieving a persons suffering. This naturally prepared me for a career in medicine. I was attracted to the field of neonatology very early, as I wanted to be an intensivist and care for babies. There is nothing more rewarding than seeing a newborn recover and go home to lead a normal childhood. I treat newborns who are born premature or those who have any problems at the time of birth. Infants who are extremely premature have a lot of complications and need intensive care for many weeks after their birth. I have the expertise required to provide the necessary care. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at NYU Winthrop Hospital , we offer whole body cooling for infants who suffer brain injury at birth. We also offer inhaled nitric oxide therapy and high frequency ventilation for infants with respiratory problems. NYU Winthrop Hospital has world-class maternalfetal medicine facilities and the outcomes of the infants in our NICU are unparalleled. We have the best survival rates in the area for infants born extremely preterm. We are a designated regional perinatal center and we provide care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
