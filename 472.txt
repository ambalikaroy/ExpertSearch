 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me I cant remember a time when I didnt want to be a physician. Ive always been fascinated by the workings of the human body and have felt empathy for those in need of assistance. I was also drawn to the fast-paced and hands-on nature of obstetrics. The miracle of pregnancy and the remarkable ways in which the female body adapts for childbirth continue to amaze me. I see patients with a variety of chronic maternal medical conditions and have had 15 years of experience in the evaluation of couples experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and stillbirth. I am the director of the adverse pregnancy outcome program, a service that strives to help couples who have experienced these problems. Our medical team consists of physicians with various areas of interest and expertise, which allows for a broad depth of knowledge and experience in providing patient care. We also recognize the intense stress that a complicated pregnancy places on a couple, and are committed to providing comprehensive face-to-face consultations with long visit times, so couples can have all their questions answered. Our focus is always on ensuring the most optimal outcome for both mother and fetus. I have received several teaching awards, including the National Faculty Award from the Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology, which I received four times, and the Excellence in Teaching Award from the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics, which I received five times.
