 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me In my early career, I was intrigued by how and why diseases develop. After receiving a grant to conduct research in England, I was exposed to advances in therapeutics and recognized the huge impact of minimally invasive endoscopic procedures. At that point I decided to focus all of my energy on acquiring the skills needed to become an expert in endoscopy. I was fortunate to participate in the development of many novel techniques and have never lost my enthusiasm for improving patient care. In addition to caring for patients, I am dedicated to mentoring others in complex endoscopic techniques and technologies. I have contributed to more than 100 scientific publications and innumerable abstracts. I have been featured as a keynote speaker at seminars and conferences nationally and internationally. I have been honored as a Master of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, which is a national and international recognition of my contributions to teaching and patient care in gastrointestinal endoscopy and my expertise in gastrointestinal diseases. I also received this organizations Master Endoscopist Award in 2010.
