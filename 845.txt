 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me My pursuit of medicine was inspired by my father and grandfather, who told me stories of their own experiences as doctors when I was a child. I was drawn to the specialty of neurology for its challenging and collaborative natureI work closely with colleagues and form long-term bonds with patients. As a neurologist at NYU Langone, I have the opportunity to be a member of a team and a lifelong student and teacher. I am a general neurologist, so I treat patients who have disorders of the brain, spine, and peripheral nerves. These conditions include migraines, epilepsy, Parkinsons disease, peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, among others. When patients come to me, they often complain of tingling, numbness, dizziness, headaches, temporarily losing consciousness, slurred speech, loss of coordination, and twitching. I provide people with diagnosis and treatment based on each persons individual needs. I can perform electromyography and nerve conduction studies to diagnose diseases of the peripheral nervous system. When I work with a patient, I make sure to listen and provide holistic care. I aim to learn as much from patients as they do from me. At NYU Langone, we take a team approach. Every person has a group of expertsphysicians, social workers, nurses, technicians, and physical therapistsworking to provide the most individualized care. We are all equally invested in achieving the best outcomes and providing the best experience. Apart from my clinical work, I explore ways to help future neurologists develop academic and professional skills. As program director of NYU School of Medicines neurology residency program, I am invested in the education and development of future neurologists. In our simulation center, weve developed a curriculum to teach residents neurologic skills and promote professionalism and interpersonal communication. We have worked to achieve a good balance in residents education through both office and hospital experiences, and to learn from our experts in the various subspecialties that our Department of Neurology has to offer. My role as director of the residency training program is challenging and exciting. It perfectly complements my role as a clinician, in which I aim to provide expert and compassionate care to patients.
