 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me I am committed to providing thorough and compassionate care to people who have head and neck cancer, thyroid disease, and parathyroid disease. My training and expertise in advanced head and neck surgeryespecially in robotic surgeryenable me to provide effective and often minimally invasive care. At NYU Langones Perlmutter Cancer Center , I work closely with my colleagues in radiation and medical oncology. Our team approach ensures the highest level of care. Together, we support our patients and their families as they learn about their diagnoses and treatment plans. I am available to answer questions, review concerns, and talk with patients before and after treatment or surgery. I came to NYU Langone to develop and lead the expansion of head and neck robotic surgery. Robotic surgery allows patients to avoid more invasive surgery, improving their quality of life and ability to swallow post-surgery. I stay up-to-date with the newest technologies to increase the number of treatments available for my patients and provide them with the best outcomes. I have lectured nationally and internationally about head and neck cancer.Additionally, I am a member of the American Head and Neck Society, including the endocrine surgery section, and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Communication and mutual trust are vital between patient and surgeon. I cherish building relationships with and caring for my patients at NYU Langone.
