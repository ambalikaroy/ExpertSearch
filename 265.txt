 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me As a dermatologist, my expertise is in diagnosing and caring for people who have melanoma and other skin cancers. In addition to helping patients manage dermatologic conditions, I teach residents at NYU School of Medicine. At NYU Langone, I take care of patients who have a range of general dermatologic needs. I also spend time in our specialized high-risk melanoma and pigmented lesion clinic, caring for patients who have many moles or a history of melanoma. Additionally, I co-manage the inpatient dermatology service at NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn , where I care for patients in the hospital who have severe skin diseases. I grew up in Scarsdale, New York, and after spending four years at the University of Pennsylvania, I returned to New York to pursue my medical education here at NYU School of Medicine. I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to practice medicine where my training started.
