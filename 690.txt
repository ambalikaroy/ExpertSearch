 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations About Me I decided to pursue a career in medicine because I take pride in providing care to people and improving their long term outcomes. As a neonatologist, I coordinate and manage care for critically ill newborns who have respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, nutritional, infectious, genetic, endocrine and neurological conditions in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). I perform procedures that include intubation, chest tube placement, needle aspiration, and central line placement. I am the clinical director of the NICU at NYU Winthrop Hospital , part of NYU Langone Health, where I work with a team of highly experienced specialists to provide the safest and highest quality of care. Our teams outcomes are among the best in the nation. In addition to serving as a physician, I conduct research focused on safe sleep studies and enteral feeding initiatives to improve quality of life for my patients.
