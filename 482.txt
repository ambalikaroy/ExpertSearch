 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me During my residency, I realized that my true passion in life was surgery, so I decided to pursue a fellowship in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. Shortly after this, I developed a great interest in robotic surgery, and since then Ive performed more than 2,500 robotic-assisted procedures. I am one of the highest-volume gynecologic robotic surgeons in the country. Video Player is loading.

My two main areas of interest are endometriosis and fertility-preserving surgery. Endometriosis is a frustrating disease, and I believe in managing all of the symptoms and concerns it raises. I have developed a network of physiciansincluding radiologists, reproductive endocrinologists, pelvic floor physical therapists, sexual dysfunction experts, psychiatrists, colorectal and urologic surgeons, and pain management physiciansto help treat each woman holistically. My interest in fertility-preserving surgery has led me to work closely with fertility specialists to optimize each womans ability to conceive and carry a child. I guide my patients through every step, from learning about their condition and developing a treatment plan to closely following up with their care. After surgery, I meet with a patient to assess her recovery, which can be done in person or as an online doctor visit in the privacy and comfort of her home. I also offer online video visits after the initial consultation and prior to surgery through the NYU Langone Health app , which gives me the ability to share and review MRIs and other images with patients. I conduct research to find better ways to diagnose endometriosis, so that we can take advantage of treatment options as early as possible. I also run an endometriosis course for doctors every year at NYU Langone, and invite national and international experts in the field to share their experiences, so we can all learn and move forward together. I lecture nationally and internationally on robotic surgery, fertility-preserving surgical options, and endometriosis. I am an active member of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, I serve on the board of directors of the Chinese American Medical Society, and I am the chair of the publication committee for the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists.
