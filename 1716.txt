 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I have always been interested in our conscious experience and how our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors interact. I became a clinical neuropsychologist because I was fascinated by the brainbehavior relationship. In this role, I can clarify the nature of cognitive difficulties and help my patients understand their cognitive strengths and weaknesses, which allows me to make recommendations to improve their quality of life. I provide neuropsychological evaluations for patients who are 5 years and older, for learning disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and cognitive deficits due to neurological conditions, neurocognitive disorders, brain injuries, and psychiatric disorders. I welcome patients who identify as LGBTQ+, and I also provide psychotherapy to older adolescents and adults. I believe in a collaborative approach to treatment to help my patients lead meaningful lives. Our Department of Behavioral Health offers comprehensive, integrated care for children, adolescents, and adults, including medication management, psychotherapy, and neuropsychological evaluations in a warm, caring, and inclusive practice.
