 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me For as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a doctor, so that I could help others. I specifically wanted to help women with their medical issues. As a gynecologist, Ive found that theres no better feeling than when I know Ive improved someones life through medicine. I love when a patient returns to the office after a visit or surgery and tells me shes feeling so much better or that Ive helped to fix a problem. Some of my patients have been living with conditions for so long that they dont remember what it was like to live without them. Its incredibly gratifying to help them realize what a healthier life feels like. When a woman comes to my office, I initially assess what she needsperhaps its a discussion about preventive health or menopausal symptoms, or treatment for abnormal bleeding, fibroids, or cervical dysplasia. Then I follow through on the discussion or treatment plan to completion. This continuity of care, from assessment to treatment and beyond, helps my patients be their better and healthier selves. I perform surgical procedures in my office and have an anesthesiologist on staff. This offers a much easier and convenient option for patients who need minor surgeries. I also perform minimally invasive robotic-assisted procedures at the Robotic Surgery Center at NYU Langone, which includes nurses, surgical staff, anesthesiologists, and gynecologists. Together, we provide patients with expert care that allows them to return to their typical daily lives quickly and, often, healthier than they were before.
