 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me One of the earliest and most important role models in my life was my pediatricianhe inspired my decision to become a physician. I always found the specialty of psychiatry appealing, because it requires that I get to know and understand the people whom I treat. As a third-year medical student, I saw firsthand how the use of biological treatments in psychiatry can positively impact peoples lives; it was an eye-opening experience. I completed my residency training at NYU Langone and have been here ever since. During my residency, I discovered the term "psychopharmacologist," which is a psychiatrist who specializes in the use of medications to treat mental disorders. Often, psychopharmacologists are called on when standard medications are ineffective or result in intolerable side effects. My primary area of interest is the psychopharmacologic treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, particularly treatment-resistant depression and manic depression. I also have expertise in the recognition and management of psychiatric medication side effects. Sometimes I receive referrals from other psychiatrists or therapists to offer my knowledge in these areas. I strive to provide thoughtful, evidence-based care that relieves peoples suffering and restores their optimism and quality of life. After a thorough and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, I collaborate with patients to devise treatment plans tailored to their specific needs. I aim to address their goals and carefully consider any additional care that they may be receiving from other health professionals. My recommendations may involve talk therapy, medication, or a combination of the two. Additionally, I may consult with or refer patients to my highly-skilled colleagues who can provide specific types of talk therapy and other subspecialized care.
