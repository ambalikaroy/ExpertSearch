 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I knew I wanted to become a physician at a young age. After doing several specialty rotations during medical school, I enjoyed my pediatric gastroenterology rotation the most. I loved learning about all of the gastrointestinal pathology. My patients range in age from newborns to young adults, and they have various conditions, including abdominal pain, constipation, reflux, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and obesity. I perform procedures such as upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and gastrostomy tube placement. I listen carefully to my patients and their parents because it is the best way to effectively help them. Additionally, my team is thorough and happy to accommodate all types of needs to give our patients the best experience. I am currently doing research in cows milk protein intolerance and breast milk protein intolerance in infants. In the past, I have participated in research involving intravenous nutrition. I am a member of North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition and the American Gastroenterological Association.
