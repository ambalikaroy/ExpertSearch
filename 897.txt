 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me Ive always been interested in science and the connection between the mind and the body, and that inspired my decision to become a neurologist. I love working and interacting with people and I was drawn to a career that would allow me to improve peoples lives. Neurology and sleep medicine are a perfect combination of my interests. At NYU Langone, I treat people who have sleep disorders. Sleep is critical to our health and it is important that it occurs in a healthy manner. Poor quality sleep is linked to several different diseases, such as depression, anxiety, mood disorders, poor concentration, headaches, chronic pain, strokes, heart disease, dementia, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Sleep is something that links all humans, both adults and children. We all need to sleep every day. My goal is to help patients improve this aspect of their lives. I have a special interest in treating people who have obstructive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, narcolepsy, and REM sleep behavior disorder. In regard to neurology, I specialize in treating patients who have a variety of disorders, with a particular focus on headaches, such as chronic migraines. At NYU Langones Comprehensive Epilepsy CenterSleep Center and the Pediatric Sleep Disorders Program , part of Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone , we perform overnight and daytime sleep studies. My technicians are with patients during the sleep study, and I interpret the results after they are performed. In my neurology clinic, I perform Botox injections for chronic migraines. With all of my patients, my biggest goal is to improve their quality of life. There are many ways that this can be achieved. I really enjoy helping my patients and I think my patients know that. I am an active member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American Heart Association.
