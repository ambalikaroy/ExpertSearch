 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me When it comes to providing patients with diagnosis and treatment for their liver conditions, my personal motto is: The buck stops with me. As a hepatologist, I see patients with primary liver disease. I have nearly four decades of experience. I listen to my patients carefully and discuss their treatment options at length. My goal is to ensure their comfort with our mutually agreed upon plan for evaluation and management. I am proud to be an academic physician who cares for patients, conducts research, and teaches medical students and postgraduate fellows in the field of hepatology. Before joining the NYU Langone faculty, I spent three decades conducting basic and clinical research on liver disease. I have published more than 100 scientific articles and remain active in clinical investigations. For 36 years I have been a member of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and a fellow of the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Physicians.
