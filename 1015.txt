 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me I am an eye surgeon specializing in oculoplastic, reconstructive, and orbital surgery, with additional training in ocular oncology. I became a physician because I was drawn to medicines blend of science and compassionate care. While I was inspired by my mothers and grandfathers practice of ophthalmology, my path to the specialty began as a medical student, when I received a National Institutes of Health grant for translational cancer research and chose to study tumors affecting the eyes. My experience gave me a deep appreciation for how important vision is to quality of life, as well as how certain eye and orbital conditions can impact this. I decided to pursue a residency in ophthalmology and fellowships in ocular oncology and oculoplastic surgery. I treat people of all ages who have conditions related to the eyelids, tear duct system, and orbit. I also manage tumors affecting the eye and surrounding areas, specializing in conjunctival, eyelid, and orbital oncology. In approaching the care of my patients, I advocate for clear communication, focused education, and compassion for each individuals needs. At NYU Langones Eye Center , we have the advantage of working closely with many different specialists, including neurologists, otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, dermatologists, endocrinologists, and radiation oncologists, delivering integrated and advanced care. These collaborations offer the knowledge, skill, and creativity necessary to deliver more choices in care. Additionally, they optimize functional recovery and aesthetic results in the most challenging circumstances. I conduct research on diagnosis and treatment methods for eyelid and orbital tumors. Recently, my work was recognized with the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (ASOPRS) Research Award.Equally rewarding and challenging has been the opportunity to participate in and contribute to an international surgical and teaching mission in Mongolia through the Virtue Foundation. This early experience in my career is one that I hope to continue to build upon in the future.
