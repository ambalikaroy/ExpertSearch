 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me I have always been dedicated to helping people. I chose the specialty of pediatric endocrinology because I love helping children, and I wanted to work in a field that would allow me to form long-lasting relationships with my patients and their families. I see patients with all pediatric endocrine disorders, however I have a special interest in treating patients with type 1 diabetes and growth disorders. As a physician and scientist, I am always trying to understand the molecular basis for my patients medical problems. I am extremely thorough and give my patients the time they need to have all their concerns addressed. My office offers dynamic testing for growth hormone deficiency, precocious puberty, adrenal dysfunction, and more.
