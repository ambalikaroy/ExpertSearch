 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me Early in my medical career, I learned that if I could improve a childs quality of life, the impact would last a lifetime. As a pediatric ophthalmologist, I approach every patient and family with this philosophy. I use age-appropriate techniques to identify potential problems with a childs vision and work to fix them so he or she has the best chance for success. At NYU Langones Eye Center , I have access to the latest ophthalmic technology and imaging to provide high-quality, comprehensive eye care to children. My practice specializes in diagnosis and surgery for pediatric and adult strabismus, more commonly referred to as crossed eyes; amblyopia, known as lazy eyes; pediatric cataracts; pediatric eye trauma; and eye disease related to prematurity. I grew up in the New York metropolitan area and had personal experiences with eye doctors from a young age, so I understand the unique challenges families in this area face. I strive to make sure every family understands all their options for treating their childs eye diseaseI formulate a plan that works best for each family. As a physician at Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone I have the opportunity to collaborate with world-renowned specialists in neurology, oncology, rheumatology, and endocrinology. By working with other specialists Im able to better coordinate my patients care, since eye health is impacted by many different conditions. My training and career have been dedicated to working with children of different ages and different needs. I have performed research and provided care in places around the world from New York and Silicon Valley to South America, Africa, and Asia. I am also chief of quality improvement for the Department of Ophthalmology.
