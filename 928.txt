 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me I became a doctor because I was always interested in two thingspeople and science. As a neurosurgeon, I get to care for people and be a part of their lives. I also consider myself privileged to be able to take care of the nervous system, because its at the very core of what it means to be a human being.

My primary interest in neurosurgery is in minimally invasive, complex, and reconstructive spinal surgery. I treat people with degenerative spine disease, reconstructive spine disease, oncological disease of the spinal cord and spinal column, and spine trauma. Spine surgery is a subspecialty that allows me to work with a diverse group of experts, such as NYU Langone orthopedic surgeons, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists, and pain management specialists. We work very closely together at the Spine Center to make sure patients get the best possible spine care. Through the Spine Center, people have an opportunity to be evaluated and receive care from many different specialists. I collaborate with these specialists to develop treatment protocols, make decisions about whether patients should have a procedure or not, and deliver preoperative and postoperative care. Patient safety is our priority. We are at the forefront of developing spinal technology and using advanced navigation and imaging to increase accuracy and safety. We are currently researching the safety of using antibiotic prophylaxis for surgical wounds, to prevent postoperative wound infections. Alongside my colleagues, I am also developing algorithms to help design safe spine treatments for the growing population of older patients in need of this type of care. Patient education is important to me. My main goal is to make people feel better, but I also hope to educate. I want people to leave my office with an understanding of their spine condition, the treatments we can offer, and what they can expect afterward.
