As an orthopedic surgeon, I am committed to researching and developing minimally invasive surgical techniques to shorten the recovery period. I consider nonsurgical options whenever possible, including braces, physical therapy, and injectable biological treatments, which use a persons own blood and stem cells to relieve pain and joint inflammation and potentially reverse cartilage damage. I also employ amniotic stem cell therapy, which is a promising treatment for people who haveosteoarthritis. My goal is to help people resume their everyday lives and return to their jobs and athletic activities. At the Sports Medicine Center ,part of NYU Langone Orthopedic Center , I am able to collaborate with physiatrists, physical therapists, nutritionists, and sports psychologists to help athletes regain their strength, balance, and endurance skills. I am a leader in our Joint Preservation and Arthritis Center , where we focus on techniques for restoring joint function and delaying the onset of arthritis in athletes and people who enjoy active lifestyles. These include meniscus repair and transplantation, cartilage transplantation, and realignment osteotomies. My clinical research focuses on improving treatments for complex problems affecting the shoulder, elbow, and knee, such as symptomatic cartilage lesions, meniscal insufficiency, patellofemoral instability, and various ligament injuries. Additionally, I lecture both nationally and around the world about orthopedic surgery and serve as team physician for the NYU and Long Island University athletics organizations. I have been recognized by Castle Connollys Top Doctors series for the New York Metro Area.
