 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me A love of science and my grandmothers stories about the people she worked with in a hospital made me want to become a doctor. At NYU Langone, Ive found a wonderful environment, not only for our patients, but for the staff and trainees as well. One of my greatest joys since coming here in 2012 has been the opportunity to mentor and teach the next generation about neurology and the many fields to which itrelates. Video Player is loading.

As a neuro-ophthalmologist, I specialize in treating patients with double vision and other vision problems related to changes in the brain, either due to conditions like multiple sclerosis or injuries such as concussions. I first listen to my patients concerns and questions. Then I tailor their treatment to ensure its best for them, their work, and their lifestyle. Its a pleasure collaborating with the interdisciplinary team at NYU Langones Concussion Center . I work with rehabilitation doctors, sports medicine experts, orthopaedists, psychiatrists, neuroradiologists, and physical and occupational therapists, and all of us share the common goal of providing our patients with the best possible care at the right time. Research conducted at the Concussion Center has led to the addition of vision testing to both sideline assessment and more in-depth testing for concussion. Such tests, including the King-Devick (K-D) test, which is based on the amount of time it takes to perform rapid number naming, help to determine how the many visual pathways in the brain are affected by a concussion, and how we can better examine and treat athletes and other patients. The K-D test is a vision test that can be administered on the sidelines of youth and collegiate sports. This test takes less than a minute and can allow coaches and parents to accurately gauge the likelihood that a child or young adult has a concussion.
