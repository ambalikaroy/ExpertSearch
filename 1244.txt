 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me Orthopedic surgery appealed to me because I have always loved the idea of helping people with injuries return to their daily routineswhether its being able to carry groceries or play baseball in the park again. I want my patients to live without limitations and without pain. As a shoulder and elbow subspecialist at NYU Langone Orthopedic Center , I treat patients with all types of shoulder and elbow conditions, including frozen shoulder, shoulder instability, rotator cuff tears, shoulder labral tears, shoulder arthritis, shoulder and elbow fractures, golfer's elbow, tennis elbow, elbow arthritis, and elbow contractures. In addition to nonsurgical treatments, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy and minimally invasive arthroscopic procedures, I also specialize in open reconstructive procedures of the shoulder and elbow. I offer patients treatments that are customized to their specific needs and demands. Whenever possible, I recommend nonsurgical options before assessing whether surgery is necessary. Because of my expertise, other orthopedic surgeons routinely refer patients who require complex procedures, such as revision shoulder replacements or muscle tendon transfers to me. I also perform clinically relevant research in shoulder and elbow surgery. I have authored or coauthored more than 80 peer-reviewed publications and book chapters. These research projects allow me to stay up-to-date on all advanced surgical techniques so I can provide the best possible patient care.
