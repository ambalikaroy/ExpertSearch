 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me Growing up, I spent many afternoons in my fathers surgical office and recall the great care he provided to his patients. These experiences inspired me to follow in his footsteps and pursue a career in medicine. During medical school, I became fascinated with gastrointestinal pathology and found surgery to be an incredibly exciting and gratifying field. I quickly realized that colorectal surgery would give me the opportunity to push the limits of technical innovation and have a significant impact on peoples quality of life. I see patients of all ages with a variety of colon and rectal diseases. At Perlmutter Cancer Center , I treat people who have benign and malignant conditions of the colon, rectum, and anus, as well as pelvic floor disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and incontinence. I utilize the latest minimally invasive, robotic, and transanal approaches to surgery. I am committed to providing people with compassionate and quality care. I seek to develop meaningful relationships with my patients and collaborate with them to design individually tailored treatment plans. Among the many recognitions that Ive received, I am most proud to have been awarded the Outstanding Resident Teaching Scholar award during my chief resident year. I have a special interest in educating those entering the field of surgery. Also, I have written for numerous research publications.
