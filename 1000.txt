 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me As an orthopedic surgeon, one of the greatest things about my job is forming connections. I develop strong connections with patients, their loved ones, and the team of healthcare providers involved in their care. This team approach involves specialists with a variety of skills. For my pediatric orthopedic patients, each childs team is personalized to his or her condition and unique situation. Dedicated pediatric neurologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, transitional care specialists, and orthotists from Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone are involved in their care. For children or adults who have bone or soft tissue tumors, including metastatic disease, I work with a team of plastic surgeons, oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, interventional and musculoskeletal radiologists, as well as orthotists and physical and occupational therapists to optimize treatment and functional outcomes. I am trained in both pediatric orthopedic surgery and orthopedic oncology and manage a wide variety of conditions. When patients have their first visit, my goal is to get to know them, understand their situation, and see things from their perspective. I provide compassionate, timely care and work to ensure the best possible outcomes. Simply put, I treat my patients how I would want to be treated. This is how my practice has been throughout medical school, residency, and fellowship, during which I received the Humanism and Professionalism Resident Award from the American University of Beirut Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, which also awarded me the Dr. Herbert R. Nassour Jr. Surgery Resident Award for superior clinical skills and work ethic. I was also inducted into the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society, as well as the Gold Humanism Honor Society. In addition to my clinical practice, I am involved in the education of medical students, orthopedic surgery residents, and pediatric orthopedic fellows. My research efforts include outcomes-based studies in pediatric orthopedics and orthopedic oncology.
