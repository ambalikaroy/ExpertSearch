 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations About Me My childhood dream was to help people and save lives. Becoming a neurologist made this dream come true. As a neurologist, I specialize in providing people with epilepsy diagnosis and care. I also treat patients with headaches, memory problems, and attention and hyperactive disorders. In my practice, I conduct long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for patients with epilepsy, vagal nerve stimulation, and presurgical evaluation for people who have refractory epilepsy. I also offer Botox injections for patients with refractory migraines. At NYU Winthrop Hospital , our Comprehensive Epilepsy Center is a level-4 epilepsy treatment center. Our dedicated multidisciplinary team uses innovative equipment to provide thorough, compassionate, and individualized care to our patients. I have participated in many national and international epilepsy clinical trials as a primary investigator. Additionally, I am a member of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society. In 2018, I received a professional leadership award from Extraordinary People in Care (EPIC) Long Island.
