 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me Medicine allows me to combine my fascination with human biology and my desire to help others. Anatomy classes and clinical rotations led me to pursue a surgical career. Urology offers a chance to be involved in patient care, surgery, radiology, and pathologyall aspects of medicine I find to be important. Urology has also historically been dominated by men, and as I was choosing a career, I felt strongly that female patients might feel more comfortable seeing a female urologist. In my practice, I largely focus on treating women with urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, in which pelvic organs shift out of position. My particular area of expertise is robotic repair of pelvic organ prolapse, and I emphasize treatments that meet each womans needs. Im also an advocate for uterine-sparing techniques for women who want to avoid having their uterus removed. When I see people in my practice, I take into account their specific needs, age, lifestyle, personal preferences, cultural and religious beliefs, and treatment goals. I consider preserving sexual function to be a particularly important goal in restoring a womans quality of life after pelvic organ prolapse or incontinence surgery. I coordinate care with other healthcare providersincluding physical therapists, gynecologists, and colorectal specialiststo create the best approach to managing pelvic disorders. I am on the faculty of NYU Langones female pelvic medicine fellowship, training both urologists and gynecologists in this subspecialty. Nationally, I am involved in teaching postgraduate courses at urology and urogynecology conferences.
