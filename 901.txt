 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me Growing up in a family of physicians and surgeons, I was naturally drawn to a career in medicine. I became enthralled in getting to know patients and their history. I have practiced medicine across three continents and have been fortunate to have formed relationships with people of all cultures. As a sleep disorder specialist, my patients are likely to have difficulties with sleep. My patients work in various fields and may struggle with insomnia, snoring, sleepwalking, or even doing complicated behaviors while being asleep, such as cooking or driving. Later in life when they retire, people come to me due to insomnia following bereavement or other setbacks in life. By helping people sleep, I gain an enormous amount of satisfaction in seeing people live fuller and more socially engaged and active lives. I interpret sleep studies and utilize all resources, including education, behavioral intervention, and medications, to manage insomnia and all forms of sleep apnea. I help patients make lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and more aggressive interventions. I also see children aged 14 and older who may have special sleep disorders, and provide care in tandem with their pediatricians and parents. I take the time to listen to my patients concerns. I develop a partnership and act as their advocate to help them achieve the best of their potential, which is only possible when they have healthy sleep. I have more than 65 peer-reviewed publications in the medical academy and continue to publish academically every year.
