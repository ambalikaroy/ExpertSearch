 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I chose my career in medicine because I enjoy helping people. I was drawn to radiation oncology due to my interest in computer science, which was my major in college. My career in medicine combines my interest in science with my aspiration to have a positive influence on people by providing care. I specialize in gynecologic oncology, skin cancers, and stereotactic radiosurgery for lung and brain malignancies at Perlmutter Cancer Center . I also attend to most types of other cancer diagnoses. My goal is to provide the best possible outcomes for my patients. I have expertise in performing high dose rate brachytherapy treatment for gynecologic cancers with tandem and ovoid applicators and vaginal cylinders. I also offer CyberKnife treatment for gynecologic malignancies. Our radiation oncology team provides innovative treatments and treats the individual needs of each unique person. I look at the treatment of the individual and not just the disease.
