 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me After seeing how drawn I was to medicine, my parents and brother encouraged me to become a doctor. Their hard work and dedication inspired me to dive in, and it wasnt long before I was particularly interested in orthopedics. Upon experiencing firsthand how engaging and full of action this specialty is, I was convinced that it was the perfect fit for me. At NYU Langone Orthopedic Center and NYU Langone Ambulatory Care West Side , I help people who have all types of shoulder and elbow conditions. I have special interest and expertise in partial, total, reverse, and computer-navigated shoulder replacements, as well as arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs and labral repairs. I am also a leading specialist in Latarjet surgerya surgical procedure designed to treat recurrent shoulder dislocations. I always put myself in my patients shoes and aim to provide the quality of care that I would want for my family and loved ones. Its my priority to be an excellent physician, researcher, and innovator, but its just as important for me to be an excellent teacher who is affable and available. One of the most meaningful aspects of my profession is the opportunity to alleviate peoples pain and improve their function. I believe that achieving successful patient outcomes requires a collaborative team to develop a treatment plan focused on meeting the specific needs and expectations of every single patient. Research is an integral part of my academic career, allowing me to constantly improve the way I take care of my patients, as well as giving me the opportunity to find innovative solutions for challenging shoulder and elbow problems. My research focuses on computer-navigated shoulder arthroplasty; outcomes related to rotator cuff repairs, shoulder instability, and shoulder arthroplasty; shoulder preservation surgery in young arthritic shoulders; and biologic treatments for shoulder and elbow conditions, including using growth factors and stem cells. I am fortunate to be recognized by peers, colleagues, and experts with numerous awards, including the Ludwig J. Pyrtek MS Research Paper Distinction Award, Arciero-Warner Best Research Paper Award, Chitranjan S. Ranawat Award, and Cavazos Residency Fellowship Award. I actively publish in peer-reviewed orthopedic journals and textbooks. I am editor for the shoulder and elbow section of Techniques in Orthopaedics and serve on the editorial and reviewer board of leading orthopedic journals, including American Journal of Orthopedics , Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery , and Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery . I am member of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and the Arthroscopy Association of North America (AANA), and I am a fellow of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (FAAOS).

Research My Research Interests stem cells, growth factors , shoulder / elbow arthritis in <50 year old, biologic augmentation of rotator cuff repairs, shoulder and elbow instability, scapulothroacic and acromioclavicular disorders, labrum healing , bone loss, shoulder arthroplasty, elbow arthroplasty, arthroscopic repairs Read more Research Summary I am a fellowship trained shoulder and elbow surgeon and I have been actively involved in conducting basic science and clinical research throughout my years of medical education. I believe that the rewards of basic and clinical research lies in its clinical application and that a clinician-scientist has the potential to bridge the gap from bench to bedside. Research is an integral part of my academic career as it allows me to constantly improve the way I take care of my patients and also allows me an opportunity to find innovative solution for difficult, yet to be solved, shoulder and elbow problems. My basic science research interests include understanding the biologic healing mechanisms involved in tendon to bone repair (rotator cuff tears, biceps tear), critical sized bone defects (shoulder arthroplasty and fractures) and labral tears (instability, dislocation). My research has focused on role of growth factors, stem cells and gene therapy for improving biologic healing mechanism in bone and soft tissue repair. My clinical interests include performing outcomes research related to rotator cuff repairs, shoulder & elbow instability repairs, shoulder & elbow arthroplasty and shoulder & elbow trauma. I have particular interest in management of shoulder and elbow arthritis in a young patient. I actively contribute to the shoulder & elbow, sport medicine and orthopaedic surgery literature and my work has been published extensively in some of the leading orthopaedic surgery journals. I aman Associate Editor for the shoulder and elbow section in Techniques in Orthopaedics Journal and also serve on the editorial board of Americal Journal of Orthopaedics, and Orthopaedics Journal.
