 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me Medicine and, more specifically, ophthalmology, has been my familys vocation for five decades. My parents are practicing physicians who gained great fulfillment from their careers. As a child, I was consumed by dinner table conversations about fascinating medical and ophthalmic cases. Those experiences sparked my interest in the field. As a vitreoretinal surgeon at Tisch Hospital and the Ambulatory Care Center , I treat people who have diseases that affect the vitreousa clear substance in the eyethe retina, and the choroidthe layer of the eye containing blood vessels and connective tissue. I perform surgery to repair retinal detachments and retinal tears and to manage retina problems associated with diabetes. I also treat macular holes and epiretinal membranes, and I perform secondary sutured intraocular lens implantation. My team is committed to providing the best retinal care to our patients. We use advanced imaging techniques to achieve the most accurate diagnostic and prognostic information. Our staff and doctors work to provide personalized care based on patients needs and to maximize treatment outcomes. While we use information from retinal research to guide our care, we also respect that every person has a unique retinal problem or concern. We are able to address individual concerns while maintaining a high level of evidence-based care. In addition to caring for patients, I also perform research to understand retinal vascular diseases, including diabetes and vein occlusion, retinal drug toxicity, age-related macular degeneration, and the outcomes of retinal detachment surgery. I have published more than 35 papers in the field of ophthalmology and coauthored The Yale Guide to Surgical Ophthalmology . I also contribute to continuing medical education and recently held a course on managing retinal vein occlusions.
