 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I was inspired to pursue a career in medicine by my parentstheyre both doctors and theyve always been strong role models for me.

At NYU Langones Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center , I treat people who have Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis. I have a special interest in working with people who have an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), and I work closely with colorectal surgeons at our center who perform this surgery. Our center is a comprehensive destination, meeting multiple needs in one location. Patients can work with gastroenterologists, nurses, surgeons, nutritionists, and psychologists, all in one convenient setting. When I work with patients, I let their values and experiences inform their treatment plan. I want to make sure that people always feel comfortable with treatment decisions. At the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, were active in clinical trials, and our patients have access to innovative therapeutics that may not be available elsewhere. In addition to providing clinical care, I conduct research on IPAA and new medications for IBD. I am an active member of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and the Crohns and Colitis Foundation. I am also the chair of the Crohns and Colitis Foundations medical advisory committee, and in 2019, I was honored to be an ACG Young Physician Leadership Scholar.
