 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me From the first day I stepped into NYU Langone as a fourth-year medical student and felt the energy, I knew this was where I wanted to train.

I eventually decided on otolaryngology because Ive always had the patience for the technical detail. I enjoy quickly identifying a problem and carrying out a plan to fix it. My particular special interest is in skull base surgery and hearing restoration, which is now done through small keyhole openings to remove benign and cancerous tumors with minimally invasive techniques. Enabling a person to hear through the use of cochlear and auditory brainstem implants is a uniquely special experience. I value the contributions of everyone who cares for a patient, from his or her family to the surgeons, therapists, and audiologists. A child with hearing loss, for example, needs all of us to work together to achieve the best possible outcome. I am most proud of our collaborative approach at the NYU Langone Cochlear Implant Center, one of the largest and most productive of its kind in the world.
