 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me My initial interest in health stemmed from a passion for nutrition and diet that was inspired by traveling the world and learning about the diets of different cultures. I later realized I wanted to have a health career that would give me universally applicable skills, so I pursued medicine. Today, I use my background in nutrition in my consultations with patients. As a preventive cardiologist, I encourage optimal nutrition and regular physical activity as a way to prevent or manage obesity, which can adversely affect a persons cardiovascular disease risk. My goal is to provide guidance. I offer consultative services regarding lifestyle modifications, such as increasing leisure activities and incorporating regular exercise into daily life, for people who are trying to prevent or have already been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. I take a personalized approach to care. I work with each person to identify lifestyle changes that can be made and sustained for long periods of time. By encouraging people to make these modifications, in combination with the use of evidence-based medical therapies, we can reduce a persons long term risk of cardiovascular disease. At the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease , I work with a team of professionals whose expertise spans the gamut of cardiovascular health. We have experts in lipid disorders, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, womens heart health, thrombotic disorders, nutrition, stress reduction, and exercise. We are involved in a number of institutional, national, and international clinical trials that allow us to study cardiovascular diseases and medications that may reduce a persons risk of developing these. My research focuses on the ramifications of obesity on cardiovascular health. Specifically, I study how cardiovascular disease risk factors are altered after bariatric surgery. My research is funded by the National Institutes of Health, the American Heart Association, the American Medical Association Foundation, and the NYU-HHC Clinical and Translational Science Institute.
