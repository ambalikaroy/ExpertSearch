 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I have always been fascinated by the human voice. After a decade-long career as a professional classical singer and singing teacher, I shifted my focus from the artistic use of the voice to its medical treatment and became a speechlanguage pathologist. I specialize in working with performers who require voice habilitation and rehabilitation. I teach people how to use their voices effectively and efficiently to meet the high vocal demands of performing. With my background as a performer, I understand the importance of vocal health and the intimate relationship performers have with their voices. I work with patients to identify which aspects of their vocal use, such as a high vocal demand or a challenging repertoire, may have led to their voice problem. I then help them find ways to optimize their technique and return to vocal health. The treatment of voice disorders requires a teamapproach, and I am fortunate to collaborate with other speechlanguage pathologists and laryngologists at NYU Langones Voice Center . Sometimes I work with other medical professionals, such as allergists or psychologists, to coordinate a patients care. Additionally, I may consult voice professionals who may already be involved with a patient, such as singing voice teachers or acting coaches. My current research investigates the effects of vocal training, voice use, and aging on the muscles of the larynx. The aim of my research is to understand how vocal training can improve vocal function in older adults.
