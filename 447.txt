I love being a practicing gynecologic oncologist, and I enjoy the rigors of surgeryI am energized every time I walk into the operating room. But it's my patients and their families who keep me engaged year after year. I am grateful for the opportunity to build long-term relationships with my patients. When I see my patients again, 5 to 15 years after their initial diagnosis, those arent just doctors office visitsthey are reunions. At NYU Langones Perlmutter Cancer Center , I treat women who have cancer of the reproductive tract, including endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer. I am a highly experienced surgeon who is comfortable creating complex surgical plans to remove extensive ovarian or fallopian tube cancer. After surgery, I craft a plan for further treatment, including chemotherapy, based on what Ive seen. For patients with endometrial cancer, I specialize in robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery. Minimally invasive surgery often allows patients to go home the same day, with reduced pain and a quicker recovery. I am fortunate to work with an amazing team of nurse practitioners, nurses, and assistants who help me guide our patients through their treatment journey one step at a time and focus on each patient as an individual. Our team follows a set of best practices so that even patients who have had extensive surgery can have a faster recovery time. As part of our holistic and comprehensive team approach, we bring together a variety of specialists and support services, including genetic counselors, nutritionists, and massage therapists. We work closely with our world-class reproductive endocrinology team within the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology to offer fertility-sparing options to our younger patients before they begin their treatment. There are always new developments in our field, and as an active member in our national clinical trials group, I'm able to share this progress with my patients. At Perlmutter Cancer Center, we have one of the largest clinical trial portfolios available for gynecologic cancer in the tri-state area. These include novel immunotherapy options and targeted therapy combinations. My research interests involve investigating best practices and outcomes in gynecologic surgery, identifying disparities in care for patients with gynecologic cancer, and investigating novel chemotherapy options for gynecologic cancers. I am a member of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
