 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me I primarily treat people with musculoskeletal pain that develops from injuries or everyday activities. Many times the people with whom I work are seeking treatment options other than medication and surgery. I use a variety of therapies to treat my patients, combining medications, exercise, and integrative techniques, such as acupuncture and meditation. Using my knowledge and experience, I determine the best course of treatment for a person, but I also ask that he or she invest the time and energy required to work toward a rewarding recovery. I develop a strong partnership with each person, because rehabilitation can be successful only if we work together. Currently, I serve as the vice chair of education and training at Rusk Rehabilitation . Teaching physical medicine and rehabilitation is a large component of my job, and often, residents help me treat patients. I value working at an academic hospital, because in addition to preparing the next generation of physicians, teaching students means that I am also continuously learning and increasing my knowledge of the field.
