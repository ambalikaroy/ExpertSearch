 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me Ive always been curious about science, so it was only natural for me to pursue a career in medicine. I was initially interested in basic science research, but quickly realized that I wanted to work directly with patients. I see patients with various conditions ranging from all sleep disorders to pulmonary disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, emphysema, and lung cancer. I also see patients with critical illnesses, such as cardiac arrest and septic shock. I perform critical care ultrasounds and advanced bronchoscopic procedures, including endobronchial ultrasound and navigation bronchoscopy. I am also highly qualified to interpret sleep studies. I collaborate with patients, their families, and other providers to help optimize peoples care. I believe in putting patients first and feel strongly that it is my role to evaluate them, treat them, and help them understand the science behind their diagnoses. I am most proud of being recognized as Attending Physician of the Year in 2017 and 2018 by the medical house staff.
