Two of the major areas I focus my research efforts on are improving patient-reported quality of life and attempting to understand each individual's cancer on a molecular level. Clinicians often focus on objective measures of treatment success, such as local recurrence and disease-free survival. Although these are certainly important endpoints, and often the primary objective of the clinical trials we conduct here at NYU Langone Health, it is equally important to ensure that we consider the emotional and physical costs of our treatments to our patients. To measure these effects, I strive to capture the patients voice in clinical trials conducted here at NYU Langone Health, using validated quality-of-lifequestionnaires. With recent advances in technology, we understand cancer on a molecular level better than ever before. I collaborate with laboratory scientists who have a deep knowledge of cellularmechanics to gain a broader understandingof the genetics and epigenetics of individual tumors, to drive therapy and inform clinical trials. Using Illumina methylation arrays, we are able to uncover the specific genetic information of individual tumors that can lead to the understanding of tumor behavior and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.
