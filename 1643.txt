 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me I am a board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeon who specializes in wound and scar repair. Additionally, Im actively involved in clinical trials to determine which new wound healing therapies are most effective for accelerated and scarless healing. Outside of family and friends, my biggest passion in life is helping people heal and making them look and feel better. Taking an open, honest, personalized approach to patient care, I believe no problem is too big or small. It is both humbling and gratifying to have an opportunity to work closely with patients to formulate the best solutions for their needs. My career in academic plastic surgery began in New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz, in a clinical practice focused on facial and breast cancer reconstruction. I was appointed the William Henderson Chair in Surgery at Tulane School of Medicine, and cofounded the Vascular Anomalies Center at the Childrens Hospital of New Orleans. After Hurricane Katrina devastated the community, I chose to remain and help the people and medical infrastructure of the city recover. In 2012, I was recruited to NYU Langone to become the director of the Helen L. and Martin S. Kimmel Hyperbaric and Advanced Wound Healing Center .Our goal is to create the highest quality wound healing and regenerative medicine program in the world, providing patients and referring providers with the most reliable source of evidence-based wound care. I have published an extensive amount of literature on plastic surgery and lectured worldwide. I am a proud member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the Plastic Surgery Research Council, the American College of Surgeons, and the American Association of Plastic Surgeons, and was honored in Castle Connollys Top Doctors series for the New York Metro Area. Also, I am an editorial board member of the Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery .
