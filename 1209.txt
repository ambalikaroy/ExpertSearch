We currently have several projects looking at clinical outcomes after hip arthroscopy. We have initiated steps to procure funding for several projects involving biomechanical hips. We also collaborate with the Department of Radiology on advancing imaging techniques for femoroacetabular impingement. We regularly present our research at the annual meetings of prestigious professional organizations, such as the International Society for Hip Arthroscopy, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine, and the Arthroscopy Association of North America. In sports medicine, my research interests include the shoulder, elbow, knee, and ankle.
