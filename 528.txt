 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I became interested in science and medicine at a very young age, and volunteering at my local hospital as a high school student confirmed my desire to pursue medicine. In college, I was intrigued by genetics and embryology and became fascinated by fetal development. As a first-year medical student, I assisted a senior obstetrician and gynecologist with data collection for a womens health study. It was during that time that I decided to enter the field of obstetrics and gynecology. I treat female patients who have a variety of urogynecologic conditions and those who previously had complicated mesh surgery or fistulae. I perform reconstructive pelvic surgery and use new technologies and minimally invasive approaches. My goal as a physician is to give each patient the best and most appropriate treatment option for her specific condition. I work with an excellent team of providers including our nurse practitioners, medical assistants, and physician assistant. We strive to deliver the best possible care for all our patients. Our positive reviews reflect high patient satisfaction and excellent clinical outcomes. We have been involved in clinical research which is routinely presented at annual society meetings and published in peered-reviewed journals. I am a fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and a fellow of the American College of Surgeons. I was the past president of the Bronx Gynecologic and Obstetric Society and I have been a member of the American Urogynecologic Society Member since 1998.
