 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me I chose to become a dermatologist because I am a thinker and a doerI enjoy the critical thinking of internal medicine and the hands-on approach of dermatology. I help people manage skin conditions, including skin cancer, acne, eczema, and hives. I also specialize in treating people who have psoriasis, and I conduct research to better understand the relationship between psoriasis and depression. My perspective on dermatology is unique. I was trained in Western medicine, but I also have an understanding of and appreciation for Chinese medicine because I was raised by my Chinese grandparents. I am interested in the similarities between the two approaches, and am open to incorporating herbal medicine and acupuncture into dermatological care. My background informs my expertise in Asian skin health and working with the elderly, but I have experience working with a very diverse group of patients. Additionally, I am interested in mens skincare and treat patients at the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Mens Health . Men often have a different approach to skincare than women, so I tailor my treatment to meet their needs. Because the center houses many different specialties together, my colleagues and I can provide convenient and efficient care. Caring for my patients is my top priority, and I always aim to address all of their concerns. Part of this involves providing people with the necessary information to make knowledgeable decisions about their care. I want people to feel comfortable and confident in my ability to meet their needs.
