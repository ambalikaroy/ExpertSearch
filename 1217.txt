 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me I chose the specialty of orthopedic surgery after being diagnosed with a herniated disc as a first-year medical student. For the next four years, I was tasked with managing my condition, for which I had two surgeries, while also training as a doctor. My personal experiences made me realize the importance of proper treatment for spine conditions, which led me to specialize in spine surgery. At NYU Langones Spine Center , I treat people who have degenerative conditions of the spine, including age-related wear-and-tear injuries that are a normal part of the aging process. Our team of orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons at the Spine Center brings a terrific depth and breadth of experience and expertise to patient care. Because of this, there is no spine condition that our team hasnt treated. In addition to my clinical work, I am involved in clinical research and have published in many prestigious journals and textbooks. Examples of my work include analyzing long-term outcomes of surgical fusion and disc replacement surgeries. I have been included in Castle Connollys Top Doctors list for the New York metro area since 2015.
