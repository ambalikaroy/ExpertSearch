 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I was raised in Philadelphia and completed medical school training at the University of Pennsylvania in 2008. Since then, I have lived in New York City and worked at NYU Langone, where I completed residency training and now serve as a full-time faculty member in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology. I practice both general and cosmetic dermatology, as well as skin and laser surgery. I treat people who have a wide variety of skin conditionssuch as acne, psoriasis, and skin tumorsand have a particular interest in cosmetic dermatology and the management of nail diseases. As one of only a few physicians in the United States who is board certified in psychiatry and dermatology, I take a thoughtful approach to cosmetic dermatology and have a unique perspective on beauty, aesthetics, and patients quality of life.
