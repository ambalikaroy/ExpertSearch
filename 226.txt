 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me Of all the professions I was exposed to in my life, medicine was the most appealing. Not only does it enable me to help a broad segment of the population, but it is also intellectually interesting, and that gives me great satisfaction. In medical school, I explored specialties related to neurobiology, a field in which I had already earned a PhD. Ophthalmology was the best fit for me: it is a wonderful mix of long-term medical care of patients and surgical management of conditions. Vision is our most treasured sense, and to be able to restore it is incredibly rewarding. I specialize in managing the most complex corneal disease in children and adults. These include infections, keratoconus, and ocular surface tumors, including malignant melanoma. I have done extensive work with the Boston keratoprosthesis, an artificial cornea that is used in patients for whom a regular corneal transplant is not an option. I am proud to have pioneered a new surgical treatment, called Descemet stripping only (DSO), for a vision-threatening corneal condition called Fuchs dystrophy, which is the most common reason for corneal transplant in the United States. DSO allows a patients own cells to rejuvenate their cornea, rather than relying on a donor cornea. The therapeutic relationships I build with my patients are very important to me. The first person I treated using DSO in 2014 has been my patient for more than 20 years. I believe in personalizing care for each of my patients and want them to feel that they are active participants in their treatment plan. In addition to my clinical work, I have authored 100 scientific studies and 7 books, and contributed chapters to 24 books. I lecture around the world on a variety of corneal topics. I have held leadership positions in several national and international societies and am currently the president of the Cornea Society. I am devoted to enhancing the status of women in ophthalmology.
