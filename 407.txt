 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me As an ophthalmologist at NYU Langone, I have the unique opportunity to work with a diverse patient population because I manage glaucoma in adults and children. Through these experiences, Im able to build long-term relationships with patients, which I find extremely rewarding. I chose to specialize in glaucoma because it allows me to provide ongoing medical care and surgical treatments to patients to improve their quality of life. Through clinical and academic opportunities in the specialty of glaucoma, I can offer meaningful patient care. During my clinical training and my early academic career, most of my research focused on the surgical management of glaucoma. I have published about several new surgical techniques as well as new findings comparing traditional glaucoma procedures to current ones. I have also been part of numerous clinical trials for new surgical devices for eye procedures.

Research My Research Research Summary Clinical research in the field of glaucoma is Dr. Panarelli'sprimary focus. Hehascollaborated with several mentors to publish new surgical techniques, evaluate the clinical impact of landmark studies in our field, and compare outcomes of various types of traditional glaucoma procedures in both the adult and pediatric population. Healso continues to be involved in the clinical trials of several new MIGS devices. Micro-invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS) are being more widely used not only by glaucoma specialists, but also comprehensive ophthalmologists, as these procedures are safer than traditional glaucoma surgeries, such as trabeculectomy and glaucoma drainage implants.As the principal investigator for several new device trials (Xen Gel Stent, Allergan and InnFocus Microshunt, Santen), hehasbeen fortunate to work on the FDA trials with many clinicians throughout the US and Europe. Theyseek to provide evidence and quantification of effect as theydetermine the role each of these devices in the evolving glaucoma treatment algorithm.The Xen Gel Stent has recently received FDA approval and the InnFocus Microshunt trial completed enrollment in 2017. He continues totrain residents, fellows, and other attendings to become proficient with these MIGS procedures.
