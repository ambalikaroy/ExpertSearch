 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me When I was in high school, I became fascinated with the genetic code built into our DNA and the exquisite complexity of the brain. Early on, I knew that I wanted to care for patients who had disorders of the brain and work to improve treatment options to increase peoples comfort during and after treatment. As a neurosurgeonscientist, I have dedicated my career to surgically treating people who have brain tumors, researching brain tumor biology, and designing new therapies. I specialize in surgery to remove gliomas, glioblastomas, pituitary adenomas, meningiomas, and brain metastases. Using minimally invasive techniques, I am able to minimize the impact of surgery on the brain. Through my work designing and running clinical trials, I am also able to offer people opportunities to participate in research aimed at advancing new treatments, techniques, and medications that can prolong peoples lives. I am dedicated to advancing the scientific knowledge of complex brain tumors, and I train and mentor future scientists and physicianscientists. I am honored to have been recognized by Super Doctors and The Leading Physicians of the World many times. Its gratifying to receive this recognition, but I most cherish the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of my patients and their families. A brain cancer diagnosis can be the most difficult and stressful period in a persons life. I am privileged to be a part of the solution and grateful to be able to form powerful emotional bonds with my patients and their families during these difficult times.

Locations and Appointments NYU Langone Neurosurgery Associates 530 1st Avenue, Skirball Suite 8R New York, NY 10016 Phone 212-263-2441 View Map Request an Appointment Research My Research Interests Glioblastoma stem cells, human embryonic stem cells, glioma biology, gliomagenesis, glioma therapeutics, cancer, imaging, molecular, cellular, & translational neuroscience Read less Research Summary Dr. Placantonakis obtained his MD/PhD degree in Neuroscience from NYU School of Medicine and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in human embryonic stem cell biology with Drs. Lorenz Studer and Viviane Tabar at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. He was also trained in Neurosurgery at Weill Cornell Medical College and Memorial Sloan-Kettering. At NYU, he is a tenure-track physician-scientist dividing his time between his neurosurgical practice and the laboratory. Dr. Placantonakis has an interest in the treatment of gliomas and brain tumors in general. The Neurosurgical Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, which is headed by Dr. Placantonakis, studies stem cell biology in the context of glioma, a malignant brain tumor. We adapt human embryonic stem cell and genetic technologies to model oncogenic processes, with the goal of understanding the early steps in glioma formation and developing translational applications, such as high-throughput drug screening and biomarker identification. Furthermore, we use genetic approaches and patients' tissue to generate models for high-grade gliomas, with emphasis on the role of stem cells in pathogenesis and new therapeutic approaches that directly target them. Our ultimate goal is to translate our laboratory findings to new therapies and diagnostic tests for patients with glioma. Dr. Placantonakis' laboratory is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and private foundations.
