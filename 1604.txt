 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I've always had a passion for medicine and the arts, and because I was dedicated to them equally, I decided to pursue them both. After college, I had a professional career in musical theatre for several years and performed at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. When I attended medical school, I realized that if I provided care to artists and performers, I could help them in their pursuit of the arts and maintain a connection to the field. I decided that the best way to achieve this was by completing a residency in physical medicine and rehabilitation, followed by a fellowship in sports medicine. At NYU Langone Ambulatory Care West Side and the Joan H. and Preston Robert Tisch Center at Essex Crossing , I commonly treat sports injuries and overuse injuries that involve pain in the muscles, joints, or back. Many of my patients are dancers, gymnasts, and semiprofessional and professional athletes, but I also work with weekend warriors or anyone whos experiencing pain. I provide fluoroscopic-guided lumbar injections and ultrasound-guided injections for the knees, hips, shoulders, and various other joints. I also perform regenerative medicine procedures, such as platelet-rich plasma therapy. In New York state, Im certified in medical acupuncture for musculoskeletal conditions to help treat my patients more holistically. As an osteopathic physician, I also perform osteopathic manipulation therapy as an alternative approach to pain management. When I work with patients, I treat the whole person. I explore conservative treatments before considering more invasive options. With my prior experience as a professional performer, I understand the importance of people healing and returning to what theyre most passionate about as quickly and safely as possible.
