 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I decided to specialize in head and neck surgery when I was a fourth-year medical student. I realized that surgery would allow me to immediately and positively impact patients lives. I remove tumors of the head, neck, thyroid, and parathyroid, and perform complex reconstructive surgery on the head and neck. Many of the surgeries I perform are geared toward treating people who have head and neck cancer. I also perform facial reanimation surgery for patients with facial paralysis.

When patients have a consultation with me, I spend a great deal of time explaining the nature of the problem and the available surgical treatment options. I try to provide them with details about the surgery and the expected recovery period, which can range from one week to six months. I perform more than 100 microvascular surgical procedures annually. Microvascular reconstruction involves transferring tissue from one part of the body to another to reconstruct an area in the head and neck to its pre-disease state. My research focuses on reconstructing the human tracheaan area for which there are limited reconstructive options. NYU Langone is one of the few places where tracheal replacement surgery is actively being investigated. We hope the surgery will enter patient trials soon. I have written more than 100 articles and contributed to multiple books over my career.
