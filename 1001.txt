 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me Unlike some specialized orthopedic surgeons, I dont regularly perform just one or two procedures in people who have similar conditions. I see people who have a wide array of conditions, from benign tumors to bone and soft tissue sarcomas. I offer a range of different procedures to manage these conditions at NYU Langones Perlmutter Cancer Center , NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital , and Tisch Hospital . I treat people using a team approach, working with plastic reconstructive surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and social workers to ensure my patients receive personalized, comprehensive treatment. I treat each of my patients as I would a family memberI would want the best care possible for my family, so I deliver the best care possible for my patients. In addition to offering treatment, I dedicate my time to teaching medical students and residents at NYU School of Medicine. They awarded me a Teacher of the Year award in 2012. I am also a board examiner for the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery.
