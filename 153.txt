 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I was born and raised in New York City, so I understand what is best and worst about living here. Early on, I was fortunate to experience some of whats best when I attended the Bronx High School of Science. My teachers there presented medical science in such a favorable light that I decided to pursue medicine as a career. I was especially drawn to how basic scientific principles can positively impact peoples quality of life. Mark Sherrid Bio Video Video Player is loading.

Cardiology attracted me, because during my training, it seemed the specialty that had the most to offer patients. As a cardiologist, I have the tools to figure out a problem, and the tools to help solve it. At NYU Langone, I treat people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the heart muscle has thickened without a medically apparent cause. As director of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Program , I lead a team of physicians who have cared for nearly 2,500 people and are experts in creating individually-tailored medical and surgical treatments. Within the last 20 years, diagnosis and treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have improved considerably, and we are able to provide excellent outcomes. Most cardiologists see only a few patients with this condition in their careers and are not familiar with new or complex treatment options. Because of our experience and immersion in the field, we are able to pick the treatment that is most likely to improve our patients wellbeing. We are grateful for the confidence that patients and referring doctors have in our judgement. I want the people I treat to be informed, so I review images and tests results with every person, explaining how treatment can alleviate symptoms and improve outcomes. The more people understand their condition and how its affecting their lives, the better. Our research comes from clinical needs. When we encounter unresolved problems in diagnosis and treatment, we aim to address them through research. Our publications have led to the widespread use of new treatments, including disopyramide for symptoms in people who have obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Additionally, papers and lectures by my esteemed surgical colleague Dr. Daniel Swistel have led other surgeons to adopt his innovative surgical techniques to improve the myectomy operation by simultaneously repairing the mitral valve.
