 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I became a neurologist because of my fascination with the brain, my interest in neurology and immunology, and my desire to improve clinical care. My career in neurology began with treating adults with multiple sclerosis, or MS, and conditions resembling MS that involve brain and spinal cord inflammation. However, when I realized that relatively few specialists were treating pediatric patients with MSwho were increasingly being diagnosed because of improved diagnostic techniquesI began to focus on treating children as well.

From my personal life, I know how important it is to parents that their childs physician has extensive background and experience in caring for children with the same rare condition. I became determined to gain as much experience and expertise as possible in managing pediatric MS. I opened the first dedicated center for children with MS in the United States. Now, I lead NYU Langones Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center , and I have launched its Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Center. The diagnostic and treatment process is difficult for both children and adults with MS, so we are committed to making their engagement with our centers as smooth as possible. As part of our clinical assessment, we evaluate fatigue, dexterity, and cognitive abilities and use sensitive neuroimaging techniques to confirm diagnoses and monitor the course of the disease. Everyone on my team, which includes nurses, other neurologists, psychologists, and social workers, knows that each person we see is different. Although treatment decisions are often the result of a collaborative effort between our team and patients, we recognize that families have different wants and needs. Some prefer to let our team take the lead in making treatment decisions, whereas others have strong preferences about their medication choices. Overall, I aim for treatments to be highly personalized, while also balancing safety, efficacy, and convenience. Our research is also geared toward enhancing quality of life, in addition to finding a cure and understanding the genetic and environmental interactions that lead to MS. We are also taking into account how each person feels in the moment and how we can make day-to-day experiences as positive as possible. Through clinical trials, we are leading the way in improving the disease course, identifying the biologic factors underlying MS, and controlling symptoms. I lead clinical research programs aimed at reducing fatigue and improving cognitive functions, such as memory and attention, in people with MS. I try to balance convenience and the benefits of therapies with potential side effects and risks. One of my clinical trials uses interventions that can be done at home for convenience. I believe its important for people to live productive, active lives while participating in clinical trials that can be integrated into their daily activities in the least intrusive way possible. I was the founding chair of the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group, and I have been invited to chair or lecture multiple meetings, both internationally and nationally, and speak about treating pediatric patients with MS. I am also honored to have been named Multiple Sclerosis Physician of the Year by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and to have received the Michael A. Maffetone Community Service Award from Stony Brook University Hospital.
