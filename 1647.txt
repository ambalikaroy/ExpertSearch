 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me As a plastic surgeon and the Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Associate Professor of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery, I aim to minimize the risks of surgery and have a positive, meaningful impact on a persons quality of life. I was drawn to the field of plastic surgery because it uses creativity and artistry to restore form and function. My goal is to work with each of my patients to achieve a natural aesthetic appearance while ensuring safety. I discuss with each patient their goals and expectations, explaining all the options available. No two people have the same expectations of surgery. Taking the time to get to know my patients helps me fine tune the procedure to meet their needs. My team and I are easily accessible and readily available to answer any questions patients may have, guiding them through the preoperative decision process, recovery, and postoperative period. I perform both aesthetic and reconstructive surgery. I also work closely with a team of specialists, including urologists, mental health specialists, and pediatricians, to provide safe, gender-affirming procedures for transgender individuals. We strive to achieve an appearance and anatomy that is congruent with each persons identity. I offer both feminizing and masculinizing procedures. For transgender women, I perform facial feminization, including hairline advancement, brow bone reduction, cheekbone augmentation, rhinoplasty, genioplasty, tracheal shave, breast augmentation, and vaginoplasty. For transgender men, I perform chest masculinization, or mastectomy, body contouring, and phalloplasty. I also offer revisions of previous surgery. Our team is at the forefront of innovation and research in gender-affirming procedures, conducting studies to improve safety, patient outcomes, and patient satisfaction. My studies specifically compare long-term outcomes of surgical procedures and look for ways to improve them by using advances in biomedical and tissue engineering. Through research and innovation, we aim to improve competent and overall healthcare for transgender and gender nonconforming people.
