 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me I grew up in a family of physicians, and as a child, I would often accompany my father, a cardiologist, to his practice. For as long as I can remember, medicine and cardiology have been fixtures in my life. Now, as an interventional cardiologist myself, I treat people who have various heart conditions, including high blood pressure, blocked arteries, high cholesterol, heart arrhythmia, and heart failure. For people who have blocked arteries resulting in a heart attack, difficulty breathing, or chest pain, I perform percutaneous coronary intervention, which is a minimally invasive procedure that can provide immediate relief, often without a prolonged hospital stay. When I accompanied my parents to their offices as a child, I didnt realize that the people who came to see them were patients, which speaks to their incredible bedside manner. I still carry with me the same habits and demeanor that I observed in them. I have an old school approach to medicine; I take my time working with patients and getting to know them, because people interact with their illnesses in their own ways. Like all physicians, my greatest efforts are put toward treating people, and I use the most advanced and minimally invasive treatments to help people in a way they find meaningful. When I first meet with patients, I listen to their needs and concerns. I collaborate with them to create a treatment plan that enables them to return to an unrestricted and fully active lifestyle with the least amount of effort. I dont want people to be limited by medical conditions. Providing people with care is my lifes passion, and I demonstrate this on a daily basis through the relationships I build with my patients. I am fluent in Spanish and English, which allows for more individualized care for my Spanish-speaking patients. I also cherish my role in deploying the latest advances in cardiology in service of my patients. At the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory , we conduct research to develop new stents and medications that can be delivered through catheters to prevent reocclusion of the arteries. I am a member of the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the American College of Physicians; but more importantly I am the same person I was when my journey began.
