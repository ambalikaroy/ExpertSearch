 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me For as long as I can remember, I was intrigued by biology and wanted to become a doctor. I received my masters degree in neuroscience, and for a while, I thought Id pursue the specialty of neurosurgery. My strong interest in anatomy and sports ultimately led me to orthopedics. Within orthopedics, I discovered spine surgery, which is the perfect marriage of the two specialties. At NYU Langones Spine Center , I treat adults who have degenerative problems of the spine, including herniated discs, arthritis of the spine, spinal kyphosis, spinal stenosis in the neck or lower back, and scoliosis caused by degeneration. As chief of technology and innovation in our orthopedic spine service, I believe in using the most advanced surgical techniques based on the latest research. I specialize in robotic surgery, a type of minimally invasive surgery that offers many benefits to patients: Its highly precise, causes minimal scarring, and allows for faster recovery, which allows patients to return to their lives much more quickly. Im proud of the care we offer to people with spine conditions through the Spine Center. Our large group of orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons has a breadth of training and experience, and we work together closely to provide the best care available. We often consult one another about complex cases, which means our patients receive the benefit of many experts, not just one. In addition to my clinical work, I have conducted successful clinical trials using artificial discs to replace damaged discs in the neck and low back. I have received the Best Paper Award at the International Society for the Advancement of Spine Surgery conference, and the Russell A. Hibbs Award for best research paper from the Scoliosis Research Society.
