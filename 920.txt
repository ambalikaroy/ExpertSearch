 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me I chose to pursue a career in neurology because I consider our brains and our minds to be the most interesting and challenging part of our bodies. Through knowledge, care, and understanding, it is my goal to improve the lives of patients suffering from stroke, headaches, cognitive impairment, and autoregulation impairment. In my office, I perform transcranial Doppler studies, lumbar punctures, and Botox procedures. I want patients to understand their diagnosis and be involved in the therapeutic decision-making process. I want them to feel we are a team and that no matter what the problem may be, we will get through it together. Each patient is unique, so I provide individualized care.
