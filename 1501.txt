I am the director of NYU Langones Comprehensive Neurofibromatosis Center , the largest and most active neurofibromatosis (NF) clinic in the United States. Caring for patients with neurofibromatosis is complex and requires coordinated multidisciplinary care. I am particularly interested in developing best practices for symptom screening, treatment, and age-appropriate anticipatory guidance for children and adults with neurofibromatosis. I recently participated in the publication of the first clinical guidelines for the management of adults with NF1. In my research, I am exploring how to treat pain in people with NF, how to prevent or reduce cutaneous neurofibromas and plexiform neurofibromas in NF1, how nutraceuticals and dietary supplements may benefit people with NF, and how best to screen for breast cancer in women with NF1. I am also working on developing new ways of measuring treatment outcomes for clinical trials of new therapeutics. Additionally, the Comprehensive Neurofibromatosis Center is a member of the Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trial Consortium, an international network of centers working to develop and carry out cutting-edge clinical trials for NF. This is an exciting time in the field of NF. For the first time we have medical therapies for these disorders that actually make a difference. The rate at which the search for a cure for NF has accelerated has been astonishing. I am grateful to have the opportunity to educate my NF patients about their condition and provide them with the very best care and access to the newest therapies.
