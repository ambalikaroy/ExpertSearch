At Perlmutter Cancer Center , I am part of an outstanding team of colleagues, including surgeons, medical oncologists, radiologists, pulmonary physicians, pathologists, and scientists. We provide people with the best possible care and participate in clinical trials to advance medical knowledge in cancer biology and oncology. I also work with a talented team of medical physicists, residents, nurses, and radiation therapists. Using advanced technology, we provide the safest and most effective radiation treatments. I pride myself in developing the best possible radiation treatment plans for individual patients. My research interests include trials in stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to treat people who have early or recurrent non-small cell lung carcinoma. I am also interested in using immunotherapy and radiation therapy for the treatment of lung cancer, as well as using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and chemotherapy to treat people who have cervical and uterine cancer.
