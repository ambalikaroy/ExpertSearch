 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me Growing up on Long Island, I aspired to be a doctor from the time I was nine years old. In high school, I was interested in anatomy, especially bones, muscles, and tendons. Then, when I was injured in a basketball game and watched with fascination as our teams doctor put a cast on my leg, I knew I was made for orthopedics.

My clinical fellowship was in reconstructive surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and then I joined the NYU Langone family in 1984, specializing in orthopedic surgery. I now perform up to 350 shoulder, hip, and knee replacements each year. My research focuses on the outcomes of shoulder replacement surgery, treatments for shoulder fractures in older adults, and methods to improve orthopedic resident education. One of the most important and meaningful things about working at NYU Langone is that it allows me to be a part of a vibrant community of professionals who provide the best, most personalized care to our patients. I sometimes wonder how the weeks go by so fastits fun to come to work every day, and it has been this way for many years.
