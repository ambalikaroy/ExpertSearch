 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications About Me During my residency in obstetrics and gynecology, I came to appreciate the significant impact infertility has on a womans life and wellbeing. This led me to specialize in reproductive endocrinology and infertilityI wanted to help women realize their dreams of building a family. As a reproductive endocrinologist, I evaluate and treat women affected by infertility, irregular menstrual cycles, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, and early ovarian failure. I provide care to those interested in starting families through donor insemination and surrogacy. I also evaluate ovarian reserve and perform egg and embryo freezing for women who desire fertility preservation for elective or medical reasons. Each woman who comes into our office has her own story and her own fertility struggles. The amount of trust that my patients place in me when sharing their fertility journeys is truly humbling. My mission is to provide compassionate care and focus on each persons individual needs. I am proud to be recognized as a fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Also, I am a member of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Gold Humanism Honors Society, and the Alpha Omega Alpha Honors Medical Society.
