 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me As a child, I watched my father take care of his patients with great compassion, and I always wanted to follow in his caring footsteps. I also suffered from asthma, but because the symptoms were mild, I didnt receive a diagnosis until later in my life. I became a pediatric pulmonologist to ensure that this wouldnt happen to other children. I treat children with general lung conditions such as asthma and bronchiolitis, as well as less common conditions, including congenital diagrammatic hernias and interstitial lung diseases. I also treat children who have neuromuscular diseases with pulmonary complications, and require advanced technology-driven management, such as ventilators and airway clearance devices. Additionally, I perform flexible bronchoscopies for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. I believe in zero harm to my patients. Quality of patient care is very important and I treat every child as I treat my own. My research focuses on infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease and pulmonary complications. Recently, my team and I have been working to publish our findings and continue to do more projects in this area. For the past six years, I have been recognized by New York Magazine s Best Doctors in New York.
