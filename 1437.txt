 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me For as long as I can remember, I was interested in biology and life sciences. Once medical school began, I realized that I loved solving medical puzzles by using physiology, and I took a special interest in the field of endocrinology. I developed an interest in treating pediatric patients, which allowed me to care for patients ranging from babies and toddlers with pediatric conditions to adolescents with problems that affect older patients. Caring for my patients motivates me every day to help improve their lives. I treat children with diabetes, thyroid disease, early or late puberty, growth failure, obesity, or other hormonal imbalances, such as polycystic ovarysyndrome. I use a holistic approach and I encourage children and their families to take an active role in their treatment. Working as a team is essential for positive outcomes. I am medical director of the pediatric diabetes program at NYU Winthrop Hospital . We use a team approach to treating children. All of our patients are cared for by our pediatric endocrinologists, certified diabetes educators and nurses, nurse practitioners, a pediatric nutritionist, and a social worker. We care for the physical and mental health of patients, and our social worker ensures the development of healthy coping strategies and offers ongoing support programs. At NYU Winthrop Hospital, we participate in clinical research to increase our patients treatment options and provide innovative diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. These studies involve prevention, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and clinical pathways. In 2010, I was recognized by the Diabetes Research Institute Foundation for my support and commitment to finding a permanent cure for diabetes.
