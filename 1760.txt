 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me As the daughter of a physicist and environmental engineer, I was introduced to science and mathematics at a young age. I graduated with a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but I chose to pursue a career in medicine so that I could apply my knowledge of science and technology to improve peoples lives and make them better. I completed my residency in radiation oncology at NYU School of Medicine. Stella Lymberis_2 Video Player is loading.

At NYU Langones Perlmutter Cancer Center , I specialize in using radiation therapy to treat women who have different types of gynecological cancer, including ovarian, vaginal, cervical, and endometrial cancer. I have extensive experience in brachytherapy, a form of radiation therapy that involves implanting radioactive material inside the body to allow a higher dose of radiation in a limited area. My goal is to deliver excellent care using the latest radiation oncology and imaging technology. I take all of my patients needs and concerns into consideration throughout their care. It is very important to address peoples understanding of their diagnosis to help them return to a normal, healthy life as soon as possible. Our excellent team of gynecological surgeons and medical physicists at NYU Langone use a collaborative approach to manage patients treatment plans. What I love most about my job is the opportunity to develop close relationships with my patients and work with them to achieve the best outcome and quality of life. In addition to treating patients, I serve as the principal investigator for several radiation oncology gynecologic clinical trials. I am involved in clinical and physics research to improve brachytherapy procedures for the treatment of various gynecologic cancers and malignancies, with a focus on eradication of disease, reducing side effects, improving quality outcomes, patient experience in brachytherapy, quality of life, and survivorship. I am interested in studying sexual health and also the psychological and emotional effects of treatment both during radiation as well as after recovery from cancer. At NYU Langones Perlmutter Cancer Center, I am a physician quality leader and a member of the research leadership team for the Gynecologic Oncology Disease Management Group , where I represent radiation oncology. Our team group participates in weekly multidisciplinary tumor boards, where we review every patients treatment plan to ensure the best level of comprehensive care. As a board member of NYU Langones Institutional Review Board, I review clinical protocols that guide the development of clinical trials to offer new treatment options to patients. I am honored to have been named as Castle Connollys Top Doctors for radiation oncology, as featured in New York Magazine , for the past five years. In 2018, I received Castle Connollys Exceptional Women in Medicine for 2018 award. During my career, I have co-authored more than 25 journal articles and book chapters, and have presented more than 50 abstracts at national meetings. I also teach and mentor radiation oncology residents and fellows in gynecologic oncology surgery. I am a member of the American Society for Radiation Oncology, American Brachytherapy Society, as well as the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
