 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me As a preventive cardiologist, I partner with my patients to help them change their lifestyles to prevent strokes and heart attacks. I help them explore a variety of lifestyle changes and medications to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease as much as possible. The job of a preventive cardiologist revolves around two things: patient discussion and education. People need to know exactly what a diagnosis means, how a medication may help, and why certain lifestyle changes can improve quality of life in tandem with medication. They also need to make meaningful contributions to their own healthy lifestylewhich can be a formidable task. I try to provide them with the resources and information to do so. My role at NYU Langone is that of a clinician and an educator. However, in an academic institution such as NYU Langone, I am educating and being educated every day. As the clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease , I have the opportunity to work with brilliant colleagues who are experts in cardiovascular disease and preventive medicine. We come together weekly to discuss the treatment and prevention of disease, challenge each other, stay up-to-date on research, and talk about how we can go above and beyond in our cardiac care. These conferences give us the chance to bring the newest research findings from bench to bedside. We are all guided by the principle that we must be both empathetic and analytical to successfully counsel patients on how to reduce their cardiovascular risk. We also conduct clinical trials on new treatments that can improve cardiac care. We are part of an international trial examining the effects of PCSK9 inhibitorsnew medications that lower cholesterol levels. We are performing trials to examine the cardiac effects of diabetic medications. We are also part of a trial examining the use of a medication, developed from genetic research, in people with elevated triglycerides. Finally, we are working on better understanding the benefits of omega-3 fish oil supplements in reducing cardiovascular disease. As part of our role as leaders in the field of preventive cardiology, my colleagues and I hold a yearly symposium for medical professionalsAdvances in Cardiovascular Risk Reductionthat draws the largest audience of any cardiac symposium at NYU Langone. We also conduct monthly lectures for the local community on a variety of topics. I have authored two textbook chapters and numerous articles on various aspects of preventive cardiology. I am a reviewer for many journals of cardiovascular medicine and diabetes, and I am a guest editor for Circulation , the journal of the American Heart Association. I have been honored by the recognition of my peers. I have been included in Castle Connollys Top Doctors feature for the New York metro area since 2009, as well as in the New York Super Doctors feature since 2009.
