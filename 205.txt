 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me When I was a child I spent hours taking things apart and putting them back together to better understand how they worked. My interest in biology and the human body, combined with my curiosity to understand form and function, made a career in medicine, specifically surgery, a natural fit. As a dedicated colon and rectal surgeon, I treat people of all ages with conditions anywhere along the spectrum of benign and malignant conditions of the colon and rectum. Some benign conditions that my patients have include hemorrhoids, anal fissures, diverticulitis, and functional bowel disorders, such rectal prolapse and fecal incontinence. Those with functional bowel disorders are often evaluated at our pelvic floor physiology lab. Concerning malignant conditions, I treat people who have cancers of the colon and rectum. For these patients, I collaborate extensively with radiologists, medical oncologists, and other cancer specialists from our Perlmutter Cancer Center . When appropriate, I use minimally invasive and robotic surgical techniques for patients. I incorporate the latest robotic surgery techniques and technology to provide people with the most advanced care. At NYU Langone, we do an excellent job of providing personal, individualized care. When patients come to me for treatment, they always work with me directly. I listen to each persons needs and concerns, and together, we come up with an optimal treatment plan with which patients are comfortable. I make sure that people have a good understanding of what the treatment process involves. In addition to my clinical care, I conduct research on functional bowel disorders and minimally invasive robotic surgery.
