 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me At a young age, I knew I wanted to pursue a career that would allow me to have a positive influence on society and help people in need. I loved all of the sciences and had a particular interest in scientific research. For me, medicine was a logical career choice. In the specialty of pediatric rheumatology, we frequently encounter challenging cases, which is why I chose it as a specialty. In these last two decades so much has happened in the field of medicine, and I am excited about the continued translation of scientific discovery to our patients care. In addition, its a field that allows me to develop long-term relationships with patients and their families. As a pediatric rheumatologist, I treat juvenile rheumatoid or idiopathic arthritis, joint pain, ankylosing spondylitis, spondyloarthropathy, uveitis, arthritis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, Kawasaki disease, localized scleroderma or morphea, systemic scleroderma, Raynauds phenomenon, vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, Behcets syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, neonatal lupus, Henoch-Schnlein purpura, sarcoidosis, and many other conditions. We provide patient-centered, individualized care and we take the time to make sure that patients and their families understand their diagnosis and its treatment and implications. We also offer exemplary care and collaborate with other specialists to treat patients with complex conditions.
