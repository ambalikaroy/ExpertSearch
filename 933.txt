 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I joined NYU Langones neurosurgery faculty as a professor and vice chair of clinical research in 2012. In addition to performing research and training neurosurgeons, I treat patients who have neurological conditions, such as metastatic brain tumors, acoustic neuroma (also known as vestibular schwannoma), meningioma, primary brain tumors, brain vascular malformations, movement and behavioral disorders, and trigeminal neuralgia. I am also director of the Center for Advanced Radiosurgery , where we treat patients with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Video Player is loading.

Prior to coming to NYU Langone, I was chief of stereotactic and functional neurosurgery and director of the Center for Brain Function and Behavior at the University of Pittsburgh. I also served as the vice chair for education and the neuroscience task force leader for the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine. I worked with the National Hockey Leagues Pittsburgh Penguins from 2002 to 2012 as their neurosurgeon. I served as the principal investigator of the first two clinical neurotransplantation trials for patients who had experienced strokes. I was the co-principal investigator of a third clinical trial on bone marrowderived neuroprogenitor cell implantation for stroke. I have also completed two clinical trials in neurostimulation research for major depression and have launched the first global registry platform for neurosurgery, which focuses on a range of conditions managed with radiosurgery. My current laboratory and clinical research into stereotactic radiosurgery spans many conditions, including benign and malignant tumors, vascular malformations, and functional disorders. In addition to conducting research and treating patients, I have published 587 journal articles and 271 book chapters, and have edited 8 books. I am the associate editor of the Journal of Neurosurgery . I am honored to have received a variety of research awards, including twice the Mahaley Clinical Award for brain tumor clinical research from the Joint Section on Tumors of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons; the Lars Leksell Award from the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies; the Penfield Lecturer of the Canadian Neurosurgical Society; the Robert Florin Award and the Integra Foundation Award from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons; the Jacob I. Fabrikant Award from the International Stereotactic Radiosurgery Society; and the Bernard Sanberg Memorial Award for significant research contributions from the American Society for Neural Therapy and Repair. I have been past president of the American Society for Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery, the International Stereotactic Radiosurgery Society, and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. I am currently the president of the American Academy of Neurological Surgery. I am the former director of the American Board of Neurological Surgery, having led the oral examinations in neurosurgery, and am now a member of the Residency Review Committee of the American Council of Graduate Medical Education.
