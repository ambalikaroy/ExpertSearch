 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me My early interest in the science of the mind, as well as in peoples life stories, put me on the path to psychiatry. I was curious to learn what leads to the development of personality and how that shapes our choices. As a clinical psychologist, I continue to derive satisfaction in helping others make life changes. At NYU Langone, I work with adults, couples, and groups. I see people who have a range of conditions, including personality disorders, mood disorders, substance abuse disorders, impulse disorders, anxiety disorders, and trauma. I frequently work with people who feel stuck in some way in their lives, and I help them move forward. I integrate techniques from dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, harm reduction, motivational interviewing, and mindfulness-based skills, as well as emotion-focused therapy (EFT) for couples. In addition, I run two therapy groups focused on DBT. I often collaborate with other professionals to determine the best treatment plan and take a holistic approach to care. I see patients at NYU Langone Psychiatry Associates in Manhattan, but for patients who live in New Jersey or who are on maternity or medical leave, Im able to offer online doctor visits through the NYU Langone Health app . I also offer these video visits to others who prefer this option, as long as it supports their treatment plan and goals. In 2015, I received the Joan Saddow Award for excellence in teaching from Mount Sinai Beth Israel.
