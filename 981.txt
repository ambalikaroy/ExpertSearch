 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me I pursued an MD and PhD in obstetrics and gynecology, because this best combined my desire to help others with my interest in having an impact on science. The field focuses heavily on translational medicine, so I am constantly researching and improving treatments. Jamie Grifo, MD, PhD Jamie Grifo Bio Video Video Player is loading.

I have pioneered techniques called preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and preimplantation genetic screening (PGS), which examine specific genes and chromosomal number in early embryo development. These procedures can be used to determine whether an embryo has genetic abnormalities that can put a pregnancy at riskand increase the odds of miscarriage or of a child being born with health problems. PGD and PGS require that cells be removed from the embryo, also known as embryo biopsy, which is considered safe. I performed the first embryo biopsy that led to a live birth in the United States in 1992. I specifically focus on assisted reproduction, helping people with fertility issues through the use of egg freezing technology and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Specialists in our program were early adopters of egg freezing technology and have pioneered its development. The first baby born through the use of egg freezing at NYU Langone was in July 2005. I have contributed heavily to the development of tools that help to measure reproductive outcomes, increase the number of successful pregnancies, and reduce the side effects of IVF. As director of the Fertility Center , I work with a team of committed physicians to raise the field to a higher standard. Fertility issues are sensitive, and infertility treatment is not an easy process. When people come to us with the unfulfilled dream of starting a family, we aim to educate them on their options, so they can take an active role in their treatment. We are dedicated to ensuring this experience is as efficient and effective as possible. My colleagues and I have been working together since 1995 at NYU Langone. For many years before that, all of us were focused on one purpose: to help people achieve their dreams of having children. Through the treatments we offer and the research we conduct at the Fertility Center, we have the opportunity to help build the world, one baby at a time.
