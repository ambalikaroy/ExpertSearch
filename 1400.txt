 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications News About Me My father was a doctor, so I was exposed to the field of medicine at a young age. I was always impressed with his dedication and humanity, and I have tried to emulate those qualities in my life and work. I decided to pursue medicine because of my interests in the sciences and helping people. Throughout my career, I have combined ongoing patient care with clinical research focused on developing better therapies. As a neurologist, I specialize in treating people who have movement disorders, including Parkinsons disease and related disorders, dystonia, and Huntingtons disease. During the course of my career, our understanding of these disorders has grown enormously, leading to great advances in our ability to care for patients. Neurology remains an ever-evolving and advancing field with exciting and promising new therapies on the horizon. At the Fresco Institute for Parkinsons and Movement Disorders at NYU Langone, I get to know my patients and address their most pressing concerns. I ask how their conditions affect their daily functioning and tailor therapies to address those needs. In addition, I am an investigator on clinical trials of novel therapies for these conditions. I believe that its important to offer patients the opportunity to participate in research, as this offers hope for the future, an opportunity to contribute to advances in medicine, and a deeper relationship between patients and their healthcare providers. For more than 20 years, I have been active in clinical research for Parkinsons disease and Huntingtons disease. I have participated in and led many clinical trials, and I have seen firsthand how clinical care and clinical research can combine to improve patient outcomes and wellbeing.
