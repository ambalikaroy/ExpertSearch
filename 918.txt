Stroke frequently devastates movement, limiting the ability to feed, bathe, dress, and care for oneself. Although the brain is capable of some reorganization after stroke, recovery is generally incomplete and inadequate. We believe that neurorehabilitation can--and should--do better. The central mission of our researchis to restore motor function after stroke by harnessing the brain's neuroplastic potential. We focus on developing methods to accelerate motor learning and recovery, and on understanding the mechanisms that underlie this acceleration. We study individuals who are healthy and who have had a stroke. Our research seeks to hone neurorehabilitation strategies, guided by our understanding of neuroplasticity and learning.
