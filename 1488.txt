 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me When I was in medical school, I looked up to pediatricians and nephrologists. I thought the work they did was unbelievable, so the choice to become a pediatric nephrologist was an easy one. Now, I treat children who have renal disease and renal failure. When Im not seeing patients, I research pediatric glomerular diseases and the impact of environmental chemicals on childrens health. I know that treatment can have varying effects on different parts of the body, even if it alleviates or fixes a condition. When I take care of children, I think carefully about how I want to treat them. I make an effort to learn everything I can about them so Im aware of any and all potential effects of treatment. I try to listen to my patients stories about why they have come to see me, rather than relying only on diagnostic tests. While available treatments can be lifesaving, they are not perfectmy aim is to strike a balance, coming up with the healthiest option that is tailored to meet each patients needs. I work with a strong, integrated staff of physicians and nurses here at NYU Langone. Together, we create balanced treatments for the children we thoroughly enjoy taking care of.
