 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Clinical Trials Publications About Me I am the first doctor in my family, and I chose medicine because I want to help people. Surgery appeals to me because it is so definitive and provides immediate results. As a cosmetic and breast plastic surgeon at NYU Langones Perlmutter Cancer Center , I see people who have received a breast cancer diagnosis and choose to have breast reconstruction. I also see people who wish to make aesthetic improvements to their breasts, face, or body. I perform breast reduction, augmentation, and lifts, as well as facial aesthetic surgery and body contouring. I specialize in all types of breast reconstruction, including reconstruction using implants and autologous breast reconstruction, in which the persons own tissue is used. Plastic surgery is an evolving and innovative field. I offer my patients the latest techniques and expertise to achieve the best possible results. Our patients are not just a number or another person in line. My team and I offer specialized care that focuses on each personwe listen to our patients and try our best to understand their objectives and expectations. Many of the patients I see had a procedure elsewhere and come to NYU Langone looking to improve upon or repair the previous surgery. It is important to me that my patients are happy and satisfied with the results of my work. I engage in research related to breast reconstruction using breast implants and breast support products. I also conduct research on three-dimensional imaging of the breast to simulate and plan surgery. I am on the board of directors of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, and I am a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
