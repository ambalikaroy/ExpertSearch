 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me Growing up in a family of physicians and dentists, I was always drawn to medicine. With a passion for procedure-based medicine and advanced technology, I chose to specialize in radiation oncology. I find it incredibly gratifying to help everyone who comes through our door. At Perlmutter Cancer Center , I treat patients who have cancer, with a specific focus on prostate and breast cancer. I also see patients who have head and neck cancer. Each person who comes to me has a unique set of needs, which is why I treat the whole person and not just the condition. I enjoy seeing how radiation changes my patients lives and allows them to thrive years after treatment. I was one of the first radiation oncologists to perform CyberKnife surgery, which is one of the most advanced forms of stereotactic radiosurgery. This procedure decreases treatment time, which allows patients to recover more quickly and return to their normal lives. NYU Winthrop Hospital , part of NYU Langone Health, is one of the largest CyberKnife practices in the United States and is a recognized training site. As pioneers in the use of CyberKnife technology, we continue to lead the research on how to improve techniques and outcomes. I am a reviewer and editor of many preeminent journals on radiation oncology, and serve as the genitourinary oncology site leader for the Radiosurgery Society. I routinely lecture and train physicians domestically and internationally in stereotactic body radiation therapy and I have hosted multiple courses on its use.
