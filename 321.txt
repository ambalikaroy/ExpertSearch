 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications News About Me Since childhood, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in medicine. I was always drawn to helping people, which led me to become a lifeguard as a teenager. During medical school, I became interested in the specialty of gastroenterology because it involves hands-on care and a holistic view of the body. I love that it allows me to provide people with truly responsive carepatients come in with a gastrointestinal condition, and Im able to offer the necessary care to relieve their discomfort. I am the section chief for gastroenterology and hepatology at NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn , where I primarily treat people who have pancreatic and liver diseases. Among the care that I provide, I diagnose cancers and masses of the pancreas and liver, insert stents to manage bile duct obstructions, and treat general gastrointestinal concerns. Additionally, I perform endoscopic ultrasound, an advanced procedure to aid in the diagnosis of certain diseases and treatment for other conditions. I created the endoscopic ultrasound program at NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn in December of 2017, and we treat more than 100 people every year. Were increasing the level of care available to Brooklyn residents by providing specialized treatment for complex gastrointestinal conditions. When I work with people, I believe in communicating clearly and openly. Im often in the position of conveying information that can be overwhelming, so I want to explain it to them in accessible terms while also offering comfort and support. In addition to my clinical work, I study the effectiveness of new endoscopic technology and treatments for gastrointestinal conditions. I also serve as director of quality for the Department of Medicine at NYU Langone HospitalBrooklyn. I am an active member of the New York Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, for which I was a past president. I am a fellow of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the American College of Gastroenterology and also serve on multiple committees in these organizations aimed at improving gastrointestinal care.
