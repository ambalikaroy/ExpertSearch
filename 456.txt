 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Clinical Trials Publications About Me For as long as I can remember, I was on the path to becoming a doctor who specialized in womens health. My passion has always been to care for and empower women who are going through difficult times. Gynecologic oncology is the perfect field for me because I get to form strong relationships with patients and their families throughout the course of treatment. I treat women who have cancer of the reproductive tract, including endometrial, ovarian, cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancer. I also treat women who have been diagnosed with a genetic mutation that increases their risk of gynecologic cancer. To help reduce this risk, I offer preventive treatments and risk-reducing surgery. I specialize in minimally invasive laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery, as well as extensive debulking procedures to remove tumors. After several years of specialized surgical training, I am comfortable creating optimal surgical plans to remove extensive gynecologic cancers. After surgery, I form a plan for further treatment or follow-up care based on the diagnosis. My aim is to treat every patient as an individual and each of my patients receives personalized evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment. At NYU Winthrop Hospital , we believe in a holistic approach to treatment which includes collaborating with other specialties and services. I work with a team of gynecologic oncologists, pathologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, genetic counselors, physician assistants, nurses, social workers, and radiologists. As part of Perlmutter Cancer Center , we have a large clinical trial portfolio available to our patients who have gynecologic cancers. These include novel immunotherapy options and targeted therapy combinations. There are always new developments in our field, and we aim to provide innovative care to all of our patients. A cancer diagnosis can lead to fear and confusion. My aim is to alleviate these concerns and pay close attention to each womans unique medical, social, and psychosocial needs. Though my goal is to optimize care and eliminate cancer, I strongly believe in maintaining a good quality of life while doing so.
