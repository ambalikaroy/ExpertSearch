 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me When I was born, my father was a medical student. I was completely fascinated by the pictures in his neurosurgery books while he was a resident. By the time I was four years old, I knew I wanted to be a neurosurgeon. Video Player is loading.

For three decades, I have remained engaged with the same clinical and academic practicecaring for children and young adults with complex brain and spinal cord conditions. I treat patients who have brain tumors, pineal tumors, hydrocephalus, normal pressure hydrocephalus, spina bifida, syringomyelia, craniosynostosis, glioma, meningioma, spinal cord tumors, pituitary tumors, optic glioma, skull base tumor, Dandy-Walker syndrome, neurofibromatosis, spinal neurofibromas, nervous system tumors, and brain cancer. At Hassenfeld Childrens Hospital at NYU Langone , we work together to provide collaborative care. When a family comes to us, they dont work with a single surgeon or neurologistthey have a whole team of experts to care for their child from start to finish. We provide for childrens medical needs as well as their psychological and psychosocial needs. When we care for a child, were conscious that were caring for an entire family. For me, theres no such thing as a small operation, even when its a short one. The only small operation is one performed on someone elses child. Whether surgery is 20 minutes or 10 hours, its a daunting experience for parents and children alike. I work to build a trusting relationship with parents so they can have confidence in the care their child is receiving. Most surgeons have only brief relationships with their patients. Its different when it comes to pediatric patients. Neurological conditions in children require decades of monitoring to make sure we address any recurring issues or unforeseen complications. For me, this has meant being able to watch children grow and develop into adults with families of their own. Im inspired by how resilient children are and how theyre able to bounce back after a difficulty. Working with them is a privilege, and its what drives my work and keeps a smile on my face.
