 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research About Me As a clinical psychologist at NYU Langone, I work with adults, couples, and families who are struggling with anxiety, chronic stress, depression, trauma, chronic medical conditions, challenging life transitions, relationship difficulties, and parenting and co-parenting concerns. I work with people who have insomnia using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). I also provide couples therapy utilizing emotion-focused therapy (EFT). I offer these types of therapy in person at my office and through online visits using the NYU Langone Health app . Online therapy visits are an option after an initial, in-person visit. Additionally, I lead a divorce support group. My approach to therapy is integrative and collaborative. I personalize my therapeutic work to best suit each patients needs by drawing from insight-oriented interpersonal therapy, CBT, EFT, solution-focused therapy, and attachment-based therapy. I also incorporate resilience and mindfulness principles to foster self-awareness and competence. Therapy can be an invaluable experience. It provides people with opportunities to become aware of their challenges and fears. Gaining this self-knowledge can lead to a new sense of freedom, possibilities, and overall life satisfaction.
