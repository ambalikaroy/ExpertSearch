 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me When I was growing up, I was a competitive senior-level figure skater. Prior to embarking on my medical career, I worked as a professional figure skater, performing aboard a cruise ship. My background in athletics combined with my lifelong passion for medicine naturally led me to pursue a career in sports medicine. As a primary care sports medicine physician at NYU Langone, I specialize in orthopedic care for conditions affecting tendons, bones, joints, muscles, and ligaments. I take a conservative approach to treatment and prefer to offer evidence-based nonsurgical care whenever possible, including regenerative medicine treatments such as platelet-rich plasma therapy. I also perform advanced ultrasound-guided procedures to treat conditions such as tendon injuries and osteoarthritis. My goal is to provide individualized care to my patients so they can return to their active and healthy lifestyles, whether they are high-level athletes with acute injuries, recreational runners with chronic injuries, or older patients who want to stay active. I have a special interest in treating people involved in artistic sports, such as figure skating, gymnastics, and dance. I continue to follow my passion for figure skating by serving as a U.S. Figure Skating team physician. I provide figure skatingspecific care to skaters of all levels at NYU Langone, and I also conduct research on figure skatingrelated injuries and injury prevention. Before joining NYU Langone, I provided medical care for athletes at The Skating Club of Boston, Boston Ballet, and the Boston Marathon. I have worked with the NBA Cleveland Cavaliers, the MLB Cleveland Indians, all NCAA Division II sports at Notre Dame College, and the MiLB Mahoning Valley Scrappers.
