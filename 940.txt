 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Research Publications News About Me My father was a doctorI used to go to the hospital with him and watch him at work. Early on, this inspired me to be like him. When some of my close relatives experienced difficult conditions requiring neurosurgery, I quickly became fascinated by what the field could offer and realized it was my calling.

I am now the director of the Anterior Skull Base Surgery Center and a member of the Lateral Skull Base Surgery Program at NYU Langone, where we offer surgical treatment to people with tumors at the base of the skull. Though many of these tumors are benign, they are located around the brain stem and near important nerves and blood vessels. The procedures are lengthy and require special techniques and experience. I have been performing these procedures for almost 30 years. I work with a unique team that has extensive experience treating people with such tumors. We work together to find the best way to reach and remove these tumors. Sometimes removing the entire tumor is not the best option, so we consider supplemental, nonsurgical treatment as well. We can sometimes treat people using minimally invasive procedures. Making these treatment decisions requires years of experience and a diverse array of expertise, so we bring in other specialists, such as otolaryngologists and plastic surgeons, to achieve the best treatment outcomes. Every time I see a patient, my first priority is to make sure he or she understands the situation and treatment options. It is overwhelming to face a brain tumor diagnosisit can turn someones world upside down. My role is to clearly explain what we are dealing with, how it can be treated, and what we can realistically expect. The fear of the unknown is what I try to allay. The key is to make this information accessible and understandable, helping to alleviate some of the fear. My research is directly linked to improving treatment outcomes for my patients. I study the anatomy of the skull base to help us understand how skull base tumors behave and affect specific areas and how to approach them in surgery. I have published papers and written books about the topic. I use this knowledge to try to remove tumors successfully and help people get back to their lives. I am proud to work at NYU Langone because everyone who works here cares. We all take pride in what we do, from the administrators, to the doctors, to the nurses, to the cleaning staff. We roll up our sleeves and do whatever we can to make peoples lives better. Its a team approach, and weve placed our patients at the center.
