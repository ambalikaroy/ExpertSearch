 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications About Me As a child, I always showed compassion toward others to offer them comfort when they werent feeling well. I always had a passion for science, particularly biology. In medical school, I knew from the beginning I was in the right place. I enjoyed bedside learning, talking to patients, understanding their concerns and symptoms, and providing differential diagnoses. I chose to specialize in neonatology to provide beginning of life care to our youngest patients. I care for premature infants with respiratory distress, sepsis, complications related to prematurity, chronic lung disease, and many other neonatal conditions. I have to think and respond in a timely fashion in order to help infants and improve the outcome of their future health and development. I also help monitor my patients through neonatal follow-up visits regarding their nutritional issues, growth, and development. I make it an important point to talk to and counsel parents whose babies are in the neonatal intensive care unit. Being there for parents by updating them on their babies progress is a major part of my practice. I strive to place myself in their position by providing patience, care, and understanding. We are here for parets and their babies. Its extremely satisfying to watch the infants I care for grow up strong and healthy, and I enjoy interacting with them and their parents when they return for follow-up visits.
