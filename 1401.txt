 About Me Credentials Insurance Locations Publications News About Me My interest in biology and psychology led to me pursue a career in medicine. I chose the specialty of neurology because its a natural combination of the two and chose to subspecialize in movement disorders because I was fascinated by how pathology in the brain can affect natural movement, which we all take for granted. I wanted to provide care to patients with movement disorders to help them maintain their mobility and independence for as long as possible. As a medical student, one of my first patients with Parkinsons disease had deep brain stimulation treatment. I observed firsthand how new technologies were able to significantly improve mobility and quality of life for people with Parkinsons disease. I treat and care for patients who primarily have Parkinsons disease, but I also treat essential tremor, atypical Parkinsonian syndromes, including progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and multiple system atrophy. Some of my patients have Huntingtons disease, ataxia, gait disorders, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. I also treat people with dystonia, including focal dystonias, such as cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, and task-specific dystonia. I perform botox injections for focal dystonia, spasticity, and hemifacial spasm. I evaluate appropriate candidates for deep brain stimulation (DBS), and I program DBS. I also evaluate appropriate candidates for, and program, intraintestinal levodopa pumps. As a movement disorder specialist, I completed a two-year fellowship and only treat people with movement disorders diagnoses. I have accumulated a wealth of clinical experience and specific knowledge on how to treat all stages of Parkinsons, from early to advanced. I understand motor and nonmotor complications of Parkinsons. I am adept in all aspects of treatment from medical management to more invasive therapies. I take the time to truly listen to patients to formulate an individualized treatment plan based on their unique needs. The team I work with consists of a nurse, physician assistant, and social worker, who are available to assist whenever needed. The mindbody connection is important to living well with Parkinsons disease. I encourage my patients to take more control of their disease through education, support groups, and changing their lifestyle to include more exercise. I emphasize that medications and surgery are only part of their treatment; each patient also needs to have control over their symptoms by exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I am a member of the Movement Disorders Society and the American Academy of Neurology.
